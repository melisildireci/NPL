Just as behavioral economics is a hybrid discipline of cognitive psychology and economics, neuroeconomics is a hybrid discipline of neuropsychology and economics. They use neural data to see how the brain makes decisions. There are plenty of monkey experiments with actual measurement of neural activity (they literally drill holes in the monkeys' skulls) and have them perform tasks, lots of fMRI experiments, things done with lesion patients and my personal favorite, the trans-cranial magnetic pulse which literally TURNS OFF some parts of the brain. newlinechar  newlinechar It is a very young discipline and, obviously, some of the findings need to be taken with caution (especially given the state of fMRI research) but it's opening lots of interesting doors. My favorite experiment was done by Colin Camerer at Caltech, they had people play the ultimatum game while in fMRI machines. newlinechar  newlinechar For those not familiar, the ultimatum game works like this: there are two players, a proposer and a responder. The proposer is allocated some amount of money, say $10. He then gets to choose an amount of the $10 to offer to the responder. The responder gets to accept or reject. If he accepts, both walk away with their respective amounts. However, if the responder rejects, both walk away with nothing. Conventional 'rational' theory predicts that the proposer should offer as little as possible and the responder should take it (since $1 is better than $0). Obviously, this doesn't happen and offers that are 'insultingly low' are generally rejected (this game has been done all over the world, there are interesting cross cultural differences which I can talk about if anyone's interested). newlinechar  newlinechar When Camerer did this experiment with the fMRI he had responders lie in a scanner and get offers from what they knew were computers and from other people. However, the people were secretly experimental confidants and some purposely made low offers to test the responders' reactions. The fMRI observed activation in regions of the brain whose activation has in other research been correlated with an affective feeling of 'disgust'  (such as when pictures of feces or maggots were shown to subjects) when low offers were known to be made by human subjects (but not when it was known that computers were making them)... it's an interesting finding that goes well along with the role of emotions as important components of decision making that some ev. psych theories push. newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest place for neuroeconomics right now is Caltech, followed by the Baylor College of Medicine and followed by NYU. There's a big debate internal to the economics community about whether we need neural data or whether just decision data is enough, which is an interesting topic in itself.

You might be right about kids as young as 14, but you are terribly wrong about young adults. newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly you're using 'Teaching Shakespeare' as a substitute for all types of education YOU find no longer relevant (I actually enjoyed Shakespeare a whole lot then, but whatever). That type of 'ol fashion learnin probably includes everything in English classes, right? What does Hemingway have to do with modern life, right? Isn't it so much better if kids are taught HOW TO CREATE MAPS FOR VIDEO GAMES? newlinechar  newlinechar This is reddit; we all like video games; we can all probably agree there's useful skills involved in designing maps. But believing we should teach kids in high school how to design game maps is, well, retarded. Literally retarded. Backward, and not forward. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want kids and young adults and adults to understand the world they live in, the world before them, and the world as it will be in the future, you better fucking have them read Shakespeare, Hemingway, Proust, and all those boring motherfucking guys.

On topic 3:  Nope.  A black hole is a thing.  A really dense thing, but a thing.  I can't tell you what happens at the center (the singularity) because the equations break down at that particular point, but it's reasonable to think of it working like a neutron star (magnatar, electroweak star, whatever floats your boat) for points that aren't the singularity.  That is, it rotates, make [jets](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080428-mm-black-hole-blazar.html) has EM fields and the like.  Except, that what goes in stays in.  For good.   newlinechar For topic 6:  The gravity exerted by one object on another gets weaker the farther out you go.  So, there's a (very) subtle difference in the strength of gravitational attraction from the Earth on your head and on your feet.  In the extreme gravity of a black hole environment that difference is orders of magnitude larger, so whatever's closer to the black hole gets accelerated more than what's farthest away.  Eventually this will rip whatever's there to shreds on the atomic level.  Because gravitational attraction involves acceleration, it's felt in every reference frame.   newlinechar  newlinechar Those are quick and dirty explanations.  I'm not a relativist, so someone more qualified than I am might want to clean up after me.

The Sharpe ratios tend to be very low for most segments, particularly about .1 above market on segments like helpful posters and people who only post things that every one agrees with. These are the investments where a steady dividend is what I am after. My riskier segments tend to have a higher though short-term volatile Sharpe, because they are more likely to increase or decrease in value. newlinechar  newlinechar I have found that the covariance between trolls and other segments has been decreasing over time. As the number of stocks available has increased, the ability of trolls to negatively affect whole segments has actually decreased, except for very new stocks which risk total liquidation in the event of high troll volatility. An increase in value in new users also has some positive correlation to value of helpful posters, as more noob questions means more opportunity to answer them.  newlinechar  newlinechar The 25% of my portfolio looking for increase in asset value has betas comparable to other investors (and is allocated largely in mutual funds that are managed by others), but you are correct that the majority of my portfolio has relatively low increase in asset value against the market. It's a low-risk, steady reward portfolio. If I was younger, I might take a riskier approach, but as I'm nearing [retirement](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ak8iy/to_the_12yearold_douchebags_of_reddit_if_you_do/c0i0zl5), I can't afford to get my portfolio wiped out in a Karma crash.

Sell anyway, and move. The property value issue is the neighborhood's problem, not theirs. The *only* place it is legal to age restrict housing is for seniors, so it's not as if there is no other option here. The needs of the many still take precedence here, and any property value fallout they endure from it is also theirs to bear. Find an affordable rental home or apartment, and sell the house as fast as possible. The bottom line that the same rules apply to everyone remains. Live by them, or live somewhere else. It really is that simple. We don't ignore them just for special snowflakes who think the rules don't apply to them. newlinechar  newlinechar Alternately, the child could be put in the custody of other relatives who don't live in retirement communities.

I've heard these claims about SecuROM before, but I've still never seen any evidence of it being installed as a ring 0 program, opening ports, or specifically sending information back to 'home'.

The thing is, there are going to be other critical situations in their marriage where one of them doesn't want to do something that has to be done, and they have to come to a better way of resolving these than 'do it behind their back'.

I do feel I need to warn you that while they are cool and entertaining, shows like on the Science Channel and popular science books are meant to attract an audience, and often focus on 'fringe' or 'ahead of the curve' research that excites the imagination without really giving great, grounded explanations.  Not all are like this, but don't take them as canon.

If you'd like to argue there aren't universal truths, that's fine, it's a different argument, although you sure better have a strong argument to back it up. More relevantly, you're right, those cultures do believe in and value different things than we do. And in places where there are proportionally huge numbers of new immigrants, that can affect the area and keep there from being a consensus on generally held values.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, this is not the norm, this is a rare exception.

Just so you know I work for a bank BTW. A Canadian chartered bank (Aka Big 5 of Canada). Also we are the same age! newlinechar  newlinechar From the other side of the coin I'll let you know what I see. My bank wants business / market share. They do that by trying to be friendly, helpful and offer essentially the same service that all the other banks offer (While trying to rely on image and advertising to bring people in). The banks make money by fees and the interest spread (Difference between loan interest rates and investment interest rates) Fees are a smaller portion of the banks income, the interest rate spread is much larger. However this only works if all loans are paid back. So unlike predatory lending institutions the bank does not want to bleed you dry. 0% credit cards / loans only bring in profits when fees or high interest penalties are added on. They COUNT on you not making all the payments, and fill the agreement with limitations and loopholes. newlinechar  newlinechar Hence my warning...

It's nearly non-existent now, however, so I really think I just stretched it out wrong and aggravated it running.  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as running, I tend to be pretty flatfooted, but I'll be more conscious tomorrow when I go for a 1 miler and see how I feel. Thanks :)

It is not 'completely different' and a lot of perceptual hashing algorithms are resistant to these kinds of changes. 
&gt;I am mystified by the Austrian school and their artificial distinction between markets and government. newlinechar  newlinechar We see basically no distinction. What makes the classes 'government' and 'citizenry' distinct is that the individuals in the 'government' group are recognized as such by both groups. Thus, in a throng of _individuals_, we call it a 'government', because that throng calls it government. This is _precisely_ why we see no difference between taxation and robbery - both involve a distant man attempting to take your stuff. That one of those men calls himself 'the government' means little to me. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My first job after college was at a mega-corporation's campus. To me, that campus felt like a barony. They were the local government. What makes the motives of a business owner any purer than that of an elected representative? newlinechar  newlinechar Very good question! Most big companies do indeed operate like a local government, and it is important to note the above when understanding why governments (and therefore any group of individuals) tend to look just like any other organization. The key difference is of course, _coercion_. newlinechar  newlinechar Let us think of two groups of individuals, one slightly larger than the other. Let us suppose the larger group enacts a rule wherein the members of the small group must never be over 200lbs by punishment of death. We would call this a 'law' and the group a 'government' because they used coercion to achieve their task. newlinechar  newlinechar So what is the difference between an elected official and a business owner? Firstly, the government official doesn't have to worry about going out of business. If there is a mistake in government, well fire he who erred. If the government is short on money, well go collect more from the tax payers - after all they _have_ to pay. If it's the leaders fault himself, he can just lie. If a business owner however cannot pay his bills - he is prevented from _robbing_ people to continue doing business. He is therefore at the whim of the consumer. Typically where one sees business looking like bureaucracy, one also sees business doing public sector work. These two go along because typically overly bureaucratic slow and unprofitable companies are replaced quite quickly by a new entrepreneur. Conversely, where one sees massive innovation, speed and reliability, one sees freedom. There is no better example of that than the internet. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They both have constituents newlinechar  newlinechar But only one can shoot and/or imprison said constituents. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they both adhere (or fail to adhere) to a set of agreed upon rules of conduct newlinechar  newlinechar But only one can shoot and/or imprison said constituents if they get mad at him for failing the rules. The other is simply a poorer man with a bad investment under his belt. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and they both can be greedy or power hungry. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree here of course. I do not (in strict economic language) believe in greed or altruism. Man acts to increase his own happiness. If happy for a man is robbing the poor or feeding starving children, then so be it. Both these activities, in a economic sense, are equally greedy and altruistic (these terms being meaningless in the science). I want to point out that 'order' as opposed to 'law' is when human beings understand that association and cooperation (ie: kindness) is more _worldly profitable_. People who think cruelty will bring them happiness are called 'crazy' and are typically honestly psychotic, or in need of a good liberal education. Therefore, order is everywhere humans are. Order is what makes topics taboo, it is what makes everyone defend innocent children. Order is a zeitgeist on the human species - law is simply armed men demanding things from other men. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why is gold better than bank notes? newlinechar  newlinechar Because I don't have to tell you about the United States to sell you gold. Because someone can't just _make_ gold (the math of why printing money is exactly equal to taxing money is too in depth to show here). In a world without the State, bank notes would be _better_ than gold, that is, they would be light and redeemable. As it stands, Government Money is simply a way of taxing you without having to hike up the tax rate. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Should I be able to use gold pieces from World of Warcraft at the mall? newlinechar  newlinechar Interesting question - but the answer is 'yes and no'. Malls should certainly be allowed to accept anything they desire, digital or no, and people should certainly be allowed to sell anything they desire, digital or no. However, because Blizzard can just 'make' (ie: spawn) 5,000 gold coins, I doubt GE will be investing in them (and now you see the problem with the government currency I hope). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If we had no federal reserve, wouldn't the banks get together to create one? newlinechar  newlinechar Each bank would be it's own reserve, yes, and it would be _wonderful_. The tacky 'FDIC INSURED' stickers will peel away, replaced by big gold statues proclaiming '5,000 tonnes in our reserve!'. People would _research_ their banking products (because they are no longer being coddled), and the entirety of the economic disaster would have been avoided. newlinechar  newlinechar __TL:DR;__ 1) Profit-motive and risk of job-loss, 2) yes but only the businessman constituents are 100% voluntary, 3) yes but only one has real consequences, 4) yes, because greed is an illusion, 5) because noone can print gold, 6) yea, probably, though they'd prolly be worth next to nothing, 7) No, they would be forced to be honest. They would be _free_.

Point taken, but what I think you are arguing for is an arms race, and I'm talking about enforcing controls that already have cousins in the system- i.e. not being able to post x number of comments/reddits in y amount of time. It's not like this is a radical step from there. newlinechar  newlinechar To fight fire with fire as I would characterize your approach brings a different feeling to Reddit. And the reason I say this is that you, at once, become much more timid about the comments you make on certain posts. I know, you can point out how this is good- I can point out how this is very bad (try to simply explain yourself in a Israel/Palestinian discussion that doesn't conform to the majority, and watch your Karma points evaporate.) newlinechar  newlinechar [As KeyserSosa put it today, the admins hoped the community-at-large could behave itself with regards to this activity- it appears even he realizes now that this is likely not the case and they will have to do *something* about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ak8iy/to_the_12yearold_douchebags_of_reddit_if_you_do/c0i0wi0)

The bomber didn't have a passport from what he overheard but the Indian man noted the bomber is from Sudan and they do this all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar Assuming this is all true and Kurt overheard it all accurately, so far facts are: newlinechar  newlinechar * Crotch bomber got on w/o a passport newlinechar * Someone helped him at Amsterdam and this someone is involved with airport security there newlinechar  newlinechar Past the facts, fiction: newlinechar  newlinechar * The Indian guy works for CIA (he could as well have been on Al-Qaeda's payroll) newlinechar * FBI completely ignored all of this (which goes even against what Kurt says) newlinechar  newlinechar So, there **is** something to investigate, and chances are it is being looked into.

You draw attention to a few of the flaws in your post preemptively, essentially lampshading them.  Your awareness of them doesn't erase them, however.   newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, you admit you can't speak for Aerik, but your viewpoint is far more reasonable (and somewhat closer to my own) than Aerik's ever will be.  You claim I misread him, but you haven't seen how reactionary, how reductionist he can actually be.  It's unreasonable for you to project your own, more eloquent viewpoint on his 'bumper sticker' and portray me as opposing it. newlinechar  newlinechar You also bring up the brevity of Aerik's post, and use it to defend him.  You use the relative brevity of your own post to defend yourself, as well, noting that the issues are too complex for you to address fully.  Your post dwarfs mine, but you refuse to give mine the benefit of the doubt in any instance.   newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially, you outright asked me for a consideration that you don't give in return.  Don't you see how inconsistent it is for you to assume I think societal constructs spring magically out of thin air, simply because I reference them without taking the time to share my theory on their extremely complex interconnected causes? newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, you quote my opening sentence without noting the context.  The entire opening sentence is an *example* of a fallacious argument, and the supposed weakness you find in it is actually part of my point.  For someone who scried the guts of Aerik's post for meaning that I've reason to believe doesn't exist, you seem relatively oblivious to the overt meaning of my post. newlinechar  newlinechar For all that, you've definitely added the most actual substance to this thread, and deserve an upvote for it.

I wouldn't have a problem with removing the downmod button from user's profile page, for example. But it opens up a number of questions: newlinechar  newlinechar -suppose you get flamed by a nasty troll. you check his comment page, and see he's making nasty, racist comments to a lot of people. As a reddityor concerned about the site, you downvote the offensive comments you see, because you truly believe that they're detrimental to the site. Is that bad? Should it be forbidden? newlinechar  newlinechar -suppose that issue is solved by making those downvotes public. By the same logic, should all downvotes be public? Should privacy on it be forbidden? newlinechar  newlinechar The typical answer on the web is moderators make the judgments, and the site becomes a game of wack-a-mole. A small group of admins call the shots, and either most people like it, or they don't. Endless bitching ensues. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the answer I come up with to that myriad of questions, based on how I've seen reddit work all this time: err on the side of letting people make their own decisions and do as they wish. We tend to focus on the outliers, the few total assholes that abuse the system. What that ignores is that for the most part the system works great. Of *course* 1% of your users will be bad apples. Let it go. For all the bitching, I don't think any site deals with trolls better than reddit in its current form. I'm proud that people like LouF have remained unbanned and free to post for years, without having any real negative effect on the site.

I'm not a aeronautical engineer, I just play one on Reddit.  Still, I would say that the problems that I would see with that are 1) each small device would have to have a radio/power transmitter on board, the weight of which I'm not sure of but might be significant, and 2) if each new device didn't have the radio/power transmitter, but instead just sort of locked into position like a lego with the other existing devices, that could create some real problems with maneuvering and such.

.. and so what?  If the prices are too high, people won't buy.  Price as determined by the market is the issue.  The price is artificial thanks to you guys.

I don't want or need coverage for AIDS, pregnancy, abortion, and dozens of other procedures.  But I don't even get to pick what I want - and the company can't let me.   This is one of many examples of how regulation destroys the market.

I always found that the fact that Muslims honor and respect Jesus tends to surprise Christians who didn't know that.  As a matter of fact, I believe that Mary is the only woman to have a chapter in the Qur'an named after her.

Yeah, this is only the second time on Reddit I've gotten that excessive 'I love you man!' feeling that occurs when A: You're too drunk with a friend, or B: When an opponent in an argument is way too reasonable a human being. newlinechar  newlinechar Misogyny is definitely the ugly core of why men can't wear dresses, but it's not something that 'men' enforce.  I think fubo's post about men enforcing masculinity rules and women enforcing femininity rules is closer to the truth, but I don't fully agree with that either.  It's so far beyond 'enforcement' that I'm not even sure it's a useful metaphor. newlinechar  newlinechar Having seen Aerik post before, though, I realize he's essentially a propagandist, trying to dismiss the nuance of the situation because it complicates a worldview he prefers, and that was essentially my problem with the post.  Pinning it on 'men' essentially closes the case on a topic with uncomfortable implications for this worldview. newlinechar  newlinechar I think people tend to jump too quickly to claiming someone is misreading them, such that online discussions can degenerate rapidly into simple exchanges of such accusations.  You can't know what I'm thinking, only what I actually type, and 'misreading' is pretty much inevitable in an debate because of that.  So I didn't intend on guilt-tripping you over that, which I myself then did to you in your most recent quoted text. newlinechar  newlinechar In this case, though, I felt that how you wanted to be read, and how you wanted me to read Aerik, was so different from how you read me that it essentially created a debate where you played all three roles, and Aerik and I didn't even have to participate. newlinechar  newlinechar Aerik and I share some responsibility there, because we made posts that didn't fully explain our opinions, but... it's the internet, what can you do.

As far as dehumanization, I'm willing to accept your statements, with the exception of whatever contradicts my main point.

He got concussion from hitting his head on the table and the floor.  To this day, I still say 'fuck him, he started it'.  So to answer your question; yes I used violence to resolve a problem.

&gt;You should probably try it yourself, maybe you'll lighten up a little bit. newlinechar  newlinechar Trust me, I have. newlinechar  newlinechar Ecstasy is just a streetname for MDMA when pressed into a pill. Sold as the pure powder, it is known as 'Molly'. Like I said, I have been around the block a few times. Often the MDMA is cut with amphetamines to increase the rush, but not always when you buy it as a pill on the streets. Ecstasy can also be found on the streets as MDA, which is very similar but slightly more hallucinogenic. Again, I am VERY well versed and informed on the subject. No lightening up needed. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as the side effects and dangers of MDMA, those listed were for MDMA, not as the street drug Ecstacy (cut with Amphetamines). Look them up yourself if you disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'In laboratory studies, MDMA has been proven sufficiently safe for human consumption when taken a limited number of times in moderate doses.' newlinechar  newlinechar You reinforced my statements. None of those warning or disclaimers I listed apply to marijuana, and nobody has ever died from pot. MDMA is a dangerous drug, which is why even in clinical environments it is prescribed in limited, controlled doses. newlinechar  newlinechar And no, it is not used clinically in California. It is treated as a controlled substance analogue in California and remains Schedule 1 as it has since 1985.  newlinechar  newlinechar I am not saying that it has no therapeutic use. What I am saying is that it is dangerous, especially when used in combination with other psychiatric drugs. Many Vets with PTSD are being treated in combination with other psychiatric illnesses. How do I know? Because I am one. Mixing MDMA with the SSRIs that I take could result in deadly side effects. Therefore it would not be considered a safe treatment. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, Marijuana does not conflict with the SSRIs, has no intrinsic dangers, and does not need to be prescribed in controlled, limited, doses. newlinechar  newlinechar

Well I was pretty thorough with my safety briefs. I had my own team of soldiers that I worked with who provided security for the patrols we had over watch of, but I still insisted that everyone whether it was their first patrol or their 500th participate in the brief. I was just in charge of the patrol security, not actual logistics, so I'm not sure how similar what I did is to what you will be doing. The few big things I always stressed were newlinechar  newlinechar  * Don't engage the locals, positively or negatively. I once had to scream at a national guard chaplain (Maj) for throwing candy to the children after I was specific about not doing that. It's hard to resist, but the last thing you want is people getting the impression that it's ok to come up to your convoy. It's bad for security, it makes it hard to distinguish real threats, and if you run one over, that's an entire family that doesn't like you. newlinechar  newlinechar  * Pay attention to the locals. They're going to know when something bad is going to happen way before you do. If a market that's usually busy is suddenly deserted, there's probably a reason. newlinechar  newlinechar  * Know everything about every vehicle you're in. Ideally they'll be a standardized load plan, but realistically there won't be. When something awful happens, you don't want to have to look for the med kit. You want to **know** that it's under the  driver seat next to the warning triangles. newlinechar  newlinechar  * If you don't understand something, say so. Every single safety brief I did was followed by acting out the SOP (standard operating procedure) for a random event I would make up. I'd grab 5 guys, tell them that they each represented a HMMWV and then say that one of them had just been killed. Then I'd have the subjects of my brief tell me what they were supposed to do. If you're mission leader doesn't do that, and you're not sure what to do, ask. They might think you're stupid. But if someone gets blown up, and you stop right next to them and get blown up too, they're going to know that you're stupid. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

Speak for yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar The very nature of the melting pot means that those who hail from all corners of the planet keep their culture, and share it with those who want to share it.  American society as a whole is non-sectarian, and thus represents the lowest common denominator by design.  That's only an insult if you are innumerate.  Try being a Uygur or Tibetan in any part of China.  If you're not Han, you get beaten down.  Try being a Copt or an atheist in Saudi Arabia, you get beaten down.  Only in America can an engineering major from Bangladesh study under a professor from Karachi without an eyebrow being raised.  Likewise, for most of the previous century a stevedore from Ulster would have no problem getting a haircut from a barber from Belfast, and his usual paper besides.  The reason for that, is because Americans keep their public and private lives separate, and like it that way.
Well I for one am sick of karma parties.
Prohibition doesn't work. Drugs should be legal too. If people could freely seek clean needles and get a real education on substance abuse (not this bullshit 'DARE' propaganda of 'just say no') for example, the transfer of diseases and users would likely decrease-and more importantly, the black market may fail to corporations (which you could argue isn't any better I suppose.)  newlinechar  newlinechar Lives are ruined because hypocritical conservatives in the 80's i.e. Reagan, Thatcher.. wanted the government to stay out of their lives, reducing taxes and virtually destroying the welfare system and public education in poor areas, (something later finished off by clinton) yet used mass propaganda to spread lies and fear and create legislation that has seen more money going to prison space for non violent drug offenders than most public schools in poor areas. This has been a miserable failure. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, this unlucky guy was PLAYING WORLD OF WARCRAFT. It is very likely that this guy was doing nothing but selling and doing pot and drugs, lazing around in an apartment for 20 hours a day playing WoW and most importantly PAYING the people who turned him in. newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck that, I don't want my tax money paying 60k a year to put people like this in prison. If he wants to spend his life that way I'm perfectly OK with it as long as he isn't selling drugs to kids.

Great! In season 5, Episode 2 titled [Darmok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok), Picard has to deal with an alien culture in which their primary mode of communication is through metaphor. The problem is: the Enterprise crew has no knowledge of their cultural history and as such lacks a context in which to make sense of the metaphors they're using!  newlinechar  newlinechar A quote from the episode goes something like (and this is an Enterprise crew member talking) 'If I wanted to explain an emotion to you in their way, I could say 'Juliet on the balcony,' but you would have no way of understanding what I'm trying to express without knowing a wealth of cultural references.'  newlinechar  newlinechar So, what I propose to you is this: You write an essay on a subject of your choosing from this episode.

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/When_does_the_new_decade_start newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Although conventional wisdom says that the new decade begins on January 1st, 2010, technically it doesn't begin until January 1st, 2011.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The reason the new decade doesn't begin until 2011 is because there was no year 0---the calendar began at year 1.

That's largely because the word and identity 'liberal' has been demonized in the United States: you can see that in your own post, liberals prefer to identify themselves as 'progressives' while conservatives have a baseline respect from everybody. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What you will find in the associated polling is that many of these so-called 'conservatives' have 'liberal' views on things: [only 18% of U.S. adults want abortion to be illegal](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1576/Abortion.aspx).

Though I disagree with your opinion of Google, I agree with your argument. We sometimes fall into the trap of being fan-boys for the popular company.

The part you snipped out was sort of important, there.  It's not clear from the context of his quote whether or not he personally believes Jews should be in Israel because God promised it to them (and actually, it doesn't matter) -- what he's doing is he's rebuting common arguments. newlinechar  newlinechar As I see it, the context of the quote most likely concerns strategy vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and in particular the question of whether or not the Palestinian population can be pacified.  Ben Gurion is pointing out that the arguments *for* Israel which may resonate with Jews, which include historicity (i.e., we Jews used to live here many millenia ago) and religion (i.e., God designated this place for us) are irrelevant to Palestinians and cannot be used to sway them in favor of voluntarily giving up their land. newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, I found this quote surprising because it seems as though Ben Gurion is on some level actually *empathizing* with the Palestinan cause -- something I would never have thought possible for him -- by saying, 'Look, I don't blame them for fighting us, and if I were one of them I would too.' newlinechar  newlinechar The last part of your quote, 'So it's simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army,' to me comes from that position: he's deduced (correctly, it seems) that because the Palestinians will not leave and neither will the Israelis, conflict is inevitable, and must be prepared for. newlinechar  newlinechar If anything, this shrewd position gave Israel the strategic upper-hand.  Zionists had been immigrating to Palestine since the end of the 19th century, and with a few isolated exceptions had been mostly welcomed by the resident Palestinian population.  Had the Palestinians shared Ben Gurion's analysis -- it will come down to us or them, and so we must be prepared to fight -- they might have been better prepared when the Nakba rolled around. newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately for them, they didn't start fighting back until the first intifada.  By then Israel was well established.

&gt;Under 'God' represents this will be done for the good and wellness of mankind . . . newlinechar  newlinechar  . . as  long as you believe in the Judeo-Christian God. Everybody else is marginalized. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The republic is pretty much the model of governance in North America. The U.S founding fathers not only drafted a masterpiece for the USA but for the entire world (if they choose to follow). Many governments in the 'free world' are modeled after this blueprint in some shape form or fashion. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, our nation was not the model for the 'free world'--Rome was. The form of government our Founding Fathers chose was a more modern adaptation of the Roman triumvirate.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There is no competition to be 'better' than anyone else's pledge or oath. newlinechar  newlinechar Then what is the point of reciting a pledge? What are we pledging our allegiance to? A pledge is something I take seriously. Why would we insist that children across the country recite this in class if you can't nail down what exactly is *written in the pledge* that expresses our most important ideals? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When the US founding fathers broke away from the King, and drafted the constitution, they were in a very dark age, and wanted to ensure would never happen again. You are seriously lacking history. newlinechar  newlinechar Remind me again: which of our Founding Fathers ever recited the Pledge?  And I hate to be repetitive, but what exactly is written into the pledge that expresses those ideas you're referring to? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;anyway the point is.. to make a pledge to be 'United' for 'Liberty' means you are one huge entity to ensure Freedom prevails. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? Then simple majority rules is what makes us great? Size matters? newlinechar  newlinechar I'll cut to the chase: the Pledge is poorly written drivel. It's the Constitution that deserves our attention. However, idiots within our country can easily recite the Pledge, yet not more than a couple of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution's amendments. Don't you think our children reciting one of them daily would strengthen our ideals?

I have never studied Rosetta Stone courses, so do not know what they cover. However, I can explain the Czech language a bit. Firstly, there is literary Czech - this is quite a formal version which you would use for writing letters or books or newspapers. Then there is spoken Czech, which is what you would use in polite conversation. Then there is colloquial Czech, which you would use in informal conversations. There is, of course, also 'street slang' which is mostly restricted to kids. newlinechar  newlinechar Then there are also regional differences. The Prague version of Czech does have an accent which some people like and some do not. It sounds a little bit like 'singing' in that some words are held longer than in other areas of the country. newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of what Czech you learn in courses, there are plenty of books and tapes for learning Czech and most cover a mix of the formal literary and spoken variants, and usually have a small section introducing the colloquial.

&gt; Does that, as written, support independent ownership for those not part of a 'well regulated militia'? newlinechar  newlinechar The people of the states **were/are** the militia, hence adding or leaving the subject changes nothing. States did not have their own voluntary military organizations, every citizen was a conscripted member of their respective state's militia. The term regulated refers to meaning organized and equipped; to be ready for action. I believe in Virginia, there is an old law that is still active that states something along of the lines of *in a time of crisis, every able body male of age is automatically conscripted into the Virginia militia*. Several key members who assisted in drafting the Bill of Rights have elaborated greatly in this area, I would recommend giving the Anti federalist and Federalist Papers a good read.  Read it carefully: newlinechar  newlinechar *A well regulated Militia* (being the people of the states), *being **necessary** to the security of a free State* (the states were practically considered their own independent nations. The federal government was never supposed to have superior power. However you want to put it the State stands for the sovereign ground that citizens live on), *the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.* newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; arms - weapons, esp. firearms. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the dictionary definition of arms. Written as it was, arms referred to anything the militia (the people) can get their hands on to fight against the tyranny of an unconstitutional government. Whether it be rakes, axes, torches, black powder rifles, cannons or pistols, tasers or the severed leg of their dog. Arms refers to a weapon. You are welcome to go a step further and acquire the definition of a weapon. I guarantee you, however, that it reads nothing about excluding semi-automatic rifles, pepper spray or a cucumber. It is not specific as to what types of weapons, therefore without ratifying change to the amendment, one cannot assume that there were specifics in mind. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No matter what, to make such a black and white assertion as 'My way is superior because I agree with my interpretation of what these guys said/trying to say' newlinechar  newlinechar This pisses me off because you took a joke and made it serious. I never once mentioned the word superior. I also never said the Constitution was perfect. If I recall, I said that there are vague areas of the Constitution, but the second amendment is **incredibly** specific. I realize people have tried to break it down and interpret it in other fashions, but frankly, I don't see what there is to interpret if you look at semantic evidence as I've laid it out before you. In terms of the second amendment, it **is** black and white, right on the document; well.. rather a faded yellow color. It is rather old. newlinechar  newlinechar As I said, to make any changes to adjust for modernization, a ratification of written changes needs to be made.

You need to add to this assessment how much of the U.S. is tied up in getting paid by the 'Defense' side of the government (you know, the part that is over 50% of the budget and creates all our deficits?). So, if they went against what the government is up to (generally = defense) they are basically killing their own jobs and maybe they'd get fired if their employers knew. This is one of the main reasons I'm interested in growing things like the space industry. Most of the gigantic defense companies could pretty easily change course to profiting from space ventures rather than taxpayers pocketbooks. Plus, does China or Al-Qaeda have a space-faring military branch yet? I think not (America = win).
There are different types of people when it comes to friends. I have a little brother that isn't happy unless he's surrounded by thirty friends.

A medic is an EMT-B who has decided to advance higher.  They undertake a 2 year long course that include didactic and hospital learning.

EMTs can assistant with some of these interventions but it is ultimately the paramedic who performs them.  EMT-Bs can give certain medications, stabilize injuries, perform assessments and vitals, perform intervention such as delivering babies, suctioning, placing oral and nasal airways, etc.  Paramedics deal primarily with advanced care. newlinechar  newlinechar As an example, a pt. is in a car accident.     newlinechar     The EMT will bandage all abrasions and injuries, stabilize the spine, stabilize any broken bones, perform a full assessment, admin. oxygen, maintain the airway and such.

due to this event I had to change job sites. A year later, at a gas station I saw a co-worker from the original site and she was compelled to tell me 'what happened.' She said the original complaint person was stealing money and was afraid I would notice, see, or otherwise find out, so this person embellished my everyday political views and supersized them, cooked up a big scary story. The point is the official police dept. was already primed to be the lacky of this sort of drama and the thief-complaintant was smart enough to use this opportunity to eliminate what they thought was a threat (me) to their stealing. The complainant did this action toward me with specific intent to get me removed from the job site, probably intending that I be fired or otherwise disappeared though that did not happen, I was simply transfered to a different site, likely due to the officer observing that I was sensible and moderate. I immediately realized that the officer was checking me out. I probably said as much or alluded to this while doing my work in a consistent and good natured manner. newlinechar I do not believe this situation would have occurred so automatically without the extreme tension in the air from the BushCo regime, that everyone was supposed to be on 'alert' ad infinitum and find a scapegoat.

Then North Korea can rattle its saber and resume causing trouble, whereupon the US once again promises to do something it knows it has no intention of doing. newlinechar  newlinechar It's like one big long game.  North Korea is like a giant nest of hornets that don't know why they're angry but somehow always are, and the US is like the fat kid that likes to poke the nest with a stick from far away, while South Korea and increasingly China are the hapless neighborhood kids that live next to the nest and end up getting stung, one way or another.  The US finds all of this very amusing.  The hornets are still pissed off. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and Japan is the weird old guy who lives at the end of the street that nobody likes.  He claims to be a 'reformed' pedophile but everyone except the US has their doubts.

Sure. You could try googling, but since you feel like being an ass, I'll do it for you. http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/Foodsecurity/ newlinechar That figure says 15%, or 30 million.

He used it as a predicate adjective, which contains further restrictions on use. You linked me to to the Merriam-Webster entry for an adverb. Are you an asshole or an idiot?

Well, I do not pay for my internet (it comes for free, but it's shitty; I don't play games, I just focus more on school nowadays so I have no need for it.) and I know what torrents are, but I watch shows streaming online at my school's library.  I pay for cable television because of the sports content that I can't stream at my own apartment, as well as Food Network (my favorite channel).  I watch HBO shows as well as other favorites on DVD, so yes I do pay for re-runs but I CHOOSE to pay for those re-runs because I want to support lesser known shows as well as having the extra content.

It's not a question of right makes right but of accepting reality and knowing when you need to compromise. Israel has already agreed to return 96% of the territories to Palestinains and do land exchanges on the rest. This is public record.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Israel will not agree to palestinian claims for return, as this would abrogate the jewish basis of the state, a.k.a. my first point.

Yeah, it's not really so hard to believe a lot of people took that out of it, because there really isn't much action. I think a good deal of that was on purpose, though, because Randy's life when he isn't The Ram is humiliating and it bores him to tears.  newlinechar  newlinechar I really understood the almost masochistic thrill he got when he was wrestling, and though I've never watched any wrestling with any sort of regularity, the whole behind the scenes vaudevillian nature of it has always really interested me. It's fun for me to think about the concept of 'heat' in wrestling. It doesn't matter whether it comes in the form of cheers or boos; it's not about being the good guy or having people support you for what you do, it's about working up the crowd and putting a good show. Deeper than that, though, are the questions about the motivations of the wrestlers themselves to be the type to put on this particular kind of show. What kind of person becomes a wrestler, that almost incestuous baby of entertainment and professional sports? What about one that voluntarily cuts himself open with hidden razor blades?  newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing that interested me about the movie is the idea of someone fallen from grace. The Ram was in love with what he did, and people loved him for it. When the movie starts, all that has dried up. When you depend on crowd reactions for the health of your ego, what happens when you realize you're only popular enough to play VFW halls? Is experiencing national popularity and then fading away better or worse than starting out as a schlub and staying that way?

Have you read the Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell? In it Gladwell provides a study known as the Colorado Adoption Project, where they compared 245 pregnant woman who were going to put up their kids for adoption with 245 parents with their biological children. As expected, in the end, they found that children brought up by their biological mother were fairly similar to their parents, however for the adopted kids, their scores were nothing like their adoptive parents. The adopted kids were 'no more similar in their personality or intellectual skills to the people who raised them, fed them, clothed them, read to them, taught them, and loved them for sixteen years than they are to any two adults taken at random off the street.'  newlinechar  newlinechar And basically what Gladwell came to conclude is that children become who they are through their peer group, and not through straight parenting.

I encourage everyone to keep up with issues like this that will inevitably affect us all as industries fight change to preserve capital and individuals find that they must band together to effect those changes that insure our health and safety. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for myself, I am a consulting geophysicist who started in the oilfield more than 30 years ago cleaning oil spills and fixing pipeline leaks. I have seen the industry work on issues and can say that it moves with the speed of frozen molasses on issues that could impact the bottom line even where public safety is concerned. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The first spill that I worked on involved cleaning spilled oil from a small creek that drained into a river and thence to a lake which supplied the drinking water for several communities. The spill was originally blamed on a rusty, aging pipeline once owned by Exxon but sold to a smaller independent (SOCO) in the 60's I think. The pipeline leaked regularly so we had lots of work keeping it in shape and cleaning spills. However, over the course of two years of revisiting this creek to clean oil thought to have leaked from the pipeline, it became increasingly obvious that the true source was not the pipeline but was from something near the pipeline just up the hill from the creek. The pipeline itself paralleled the creek at the leak site. After much research we ended up digging a trench up the hill from the pipeline and we managed to find an old, unplugged well that had been noted on drilling records from the boom days (20's and 30's here). In those days, activity was hot and if a well didn't produce X barrels of oil per day it was considered 'dry' and was abandoned usually without being plugged. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We found the original borehole which was, due to increased hydraulic fracturing and injection of salt-water and other production waste, serving as a conduit straight to the surface where it contaminated groundwater, land, and the creek mentioned above. Of course the pipeline operator managed to dodge some cleanup costs when the well was located though he was hit for all costs related to his pipeline. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Fine times those were. Nothing like a night spent with a water pump in a johnboat holding a 2' hose nippled down to 1' chasing crude oil down the river while the sleet stung your face, wishing that you were on the bank with a rake stirring the oil-soaked hay while it burned in a pit and wishing that Railroad Commissioner observing your work would give you a shot of whatever it was that he was drinking because your last beer turned to piss hours ago. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Knowledge is power.

Venus does have an atmosphere, yes, but it's all carbon dioxide with a little bit of nitrogen. There's no hydrogen, and hence no water. Without a magnetic field, water in the upper atmosphere is broken into hydrogen and oxygen when it collides with solar wind particles.  Hydrogen, on its own, is too light to be held by the planet's gravity and it drifts away. That's why both Venus and Mars have so little water. Also, Venus is much more massive than Mars. The mass of Venus is 0.815 earths; Mars is 0.151 earths. So Mars is affected far more by solar wind. It holds its atmosphere very weakly.

I looked into it a bit. Insurance &amp; and Medicaid no longer cover circumcision in MN. It is a cash only, pay up front procedure.

Took a lot of pain to gain this 'wisdom'! But in the end no-one is responsible for anyone else's happiness - it is silly to imagine that someone will 'make' you happy. My wife and I had a phrase 'I deal with my shit, you deal with your shit and then there will be no shit in the middle' I think it worked and there seems to be no stress whatsoever in being together. The thing is men and women have been conditioned into role or game playing in order to hook up. What people don't understand is that the games are simply a mating ritual to reinforce initial attraction only. Once you have a 'relationship' the games are meant to stop. But mostly I think you hit the nail on the head 1+1 must become 2 not 1, you have to have happy complete lives independent of each other and 'share' the good parts of those lives while not letting the bad parts (the 'shit')  impact on your partner.

No.  You are wrong.  Your reasoning is not valid.  You've drawn an invalid conclusion based on the statement presented.  Something does not have to be immoral in order to find it dishonorable and contemptible.  He has a skill and talent that could better the planet for many people, however his primary focus is (most likely) on his own personal financial gain and the financial gain of an already elite group.  Any benefits to society will probably be an ancillary side effect of his efforts, if there are any at all.   I don't think self-centered pursuits or unfulfilled potential are particularly immoral, but I don't have to respect them either. newlinechar 
From your comment, I gather you enjoy the societal commentary involved with his strip.  In other words, you enjoy his anecdotes because you can relate to them; while due to your age, that is not true for his pre-2000 work.   newlinechar  newlinechar His pre 98 work didn't really deal with any big societal event (except for the release of certain Jason-centric movies: Batman, Jurassic Park, Star Wars Ep 1).  That work was timeless, it dealt with the humor found in childhood, in the familial relationships we all experience.  It dealt with lackadaisical 16 year old, an aspiring teenager trying to overcome the middle-child syndrome and become the beauty that every 14 year old desires, and finally a child enjoying the prime years of his life.  Jason was the only character who was given an 'unusual' eccentricity, unparalleled brilliance.  Coupled with his belief in infinite pontential that is common with almsot all kids, the audience was treated to some rather amusing scenarios.  newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't kept up with his recent work, but it seems to revolve primarily around exaggerated traits of the character: Peter and his insatiable appetite, Pagie's shopping.  They are no longer 'real' people, but immensely over-embelished caricatures.  There are only so many jokes that you can get from these personalities, and he has been rehashing them over and over.  Yes he gets momentary relief when he focuses on current societal events as inspiration, but those strips in my opinion don't share the same DNA as the rest of the comic.   newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, before he shifted to his Sunday-only format, his Sunday strips became predominantly white space.  Humor stretched out simply becuase there was sapce to fill it.  In contrast, you see Waterson's work and in almost every single instance, he utilizes the space allotted to him.  Even if it is white space, he masterfully crafts it to build up tension. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, in summary, pre '98 Foxtrot was awesome partially because it is timeless, just like Calvin and Hobbes.  The themes of sibling rivalry, spousal differences, clashing personalities exist for every single person.  That humor will never age.

A common question but tough to answer. I guess I realized early that I have a high pain tolerance. In high school it manifested in very Jackass-style stupidity, took a long break, and at about 25 I realized how unusual my tolerance was. I'm trying to move beyond just pain based acts at this point.
It started off in high school. My mom, who knows me so well, suspected something was going on, so she started going through my text messages, reading emails or IM that I had left open, and later on I found there was a keylogger installed on my computer. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, once she knew that I was seeing someone, she was actually more calm than I expected. I thought she would freak out that I was dating at all, since it's prohibited in Islam. But she didn't, so this made me think that I could confide more in her, maybe further strengthening my mom and I's relationship. **Wrong.** newlinechar  newlinechar When my mom found out that she was Jewish, she flipped out about how Jewish people are conniving, deceitful and if I had kids with her how they would all turn out to be horrible. From that point on I was basically on house arrest and had to sneak out of the house to see her. Sometimes when I had legitimate reasons to leave the house, I couldn't because she suspected I was going to try to see her. newlinechar  newlinechar Probably the funniest episode was when my mom tried to *contractually* obligate us not to touch each other. My mom invited the Jewish girl to our house 'just to meet her'. Moments after she arrives (But after offering baklava to the both of us), my mom whips out contracts and tells us nobody is leaving until we sign the contracts. The look on my mom's face was coldly serious. I was deeply embarrassed and couldn't say anything at all. The look on my girlfriend's face was pure 'WTF'. My girlfriend and I read over the contracts, which was bulleted with conditions like: newlinechar  newlinechar * You will not touch each other newlinechar * You will not move out of your house until you're married newlinechar * You will not be in a private place without supervision newlinechar  newlinechar and on and on. I wish I could remember everything that was on there. Eventually, my girlfriend got out of it by politely insisting that her parents were going to force her to move out of the house for college. I think at that point my mom saw that it was a little bit ludicrous and let us go. newlinechar  newlinechar Me and the girl eventually broke up, but looking back, it was amazing how cooperative and patient she was with all the shit that came up because of my family. I love my mom of course and we have a good relationship today. I bet if I asked her to try to find the contracts for a laugh, she would do it. She is really a wonderful woman, although maybe a little set in her ways. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Formatting fail

Many American public transit systems blow dead goats for nickles because there's a stigma attached to using public transit, _especially_ buses. There's the whole 'independence' issue of things.

Either way, I think it goes to show that parenting doesn't have as great an effect on rearing a child as many people think it would. More often than not, your child is more affected by the environment they grow up in and the kids they hang out with. For more information, David Rowe's _The Limit on Family Influence_ can shed more information on the effect of parenting.

You fucking moron, even the US Government recognizes the terrorists here: 'The Kach party has been banned in Israel since 1988. The State Department has listed Kach as a terrorist organization since 1994 and noted in a 2006 report that Kfar Tapuah is one of its bases. '

I would rather see small, elegant, and very focused forms of AI and higher order algorithms than a motherbrain type build.

It's like shoehorning Game Theory AI into scenarios it really isn't built for. 
What I dislike about the anti-censorship group(s) is that they're protesting the wrong thing. The problem is that this is stupid censorship. It is a waste of time and money, will do absolutely nothing to combat the proliferation of child pornography or any other Refused Classification material, and will have the extremely unfortunate side-effect of making everyone feel safer, while the real criminals continue to operate, because it's a half-assed solution that can be safely and reliably circumvented in a few minutes by anyone with half a brain or access to a search engine.

I still enjoy Shakespeare. Much like I still enjoy Counter-Strike. But neither one has a place in our schools. newlinechar  newlinechar Wrong. Want to learn how to 'kill a terrorist', play CS or join the army for the real thing. Want to learn about political manipulation so you don't fall prey to it? Read Macbeth or Hamlet. newlinechar  newlinechar The different between Shakespeare and CS is that Shakespeare is *art*, CS is just *entertainment*. There is a huge difference between these two categories. Shakespeare is meant to be appreciated, cross-culturally, and make us take a critical look at things. CS is meant to satisfy our primal urge to kill. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, actually, you want them reading BBC news. You want them analyzing CNN pieces. You want them analyzing Fox News. You want them exploring the world as it is, not as it was 300+ years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Shakespeare especially, with his soliloquies and other character development steps, emphasizes the role of the personal agenda in each play. Without this analysis, a child should *NOT* be watching CNN or BBS, much less **Fox**. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Separated quotes.

The awesome thing about libertarianism is that everyone is allowed to believe anything they want as long as they don't try to force their beliefs on others. The leaders can believe any ridiculous theories they want and it does not make even the slightest difference since according to their own beliefs it's not ok for them to force anyone else to follow them. Religion is completely irrelevant to politics in a true libertarian view.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Ron Paul's views on abortion - while counter to my own - are not based on religion or 'anti-freedom' at all. In fact he makes the only *good* argument against abortion that I know of: that a child is a human with a right to live. As a person who has delivered tons of babies himself I'm not exactly shocked that he values the life of babies.  newlinechar  newlinechar One of my best friends is going through a medicinal abortion right now and has been for a couple weeks. For them it was the smartest choice, but that doesn't make it easy. Ask any sane pregnant woman if she takes joy in killing her own child, well developed or not, and the answer will be a resounding NO.  newlinechar  newlinechar I've always thought there should be a point after which an abortion *should* be illegal because it *is* a person, but I'm not here to argue where that point should be. My point is nothing you are saying is at all relevant to the ideas of freedom - because freedom means that the freedom of others is every bit as great as yours. That means they can worship god, the FSM, or narwhals and it really couldn't matter any less.

I work in a hospital now, so my wearing of a uniform  is infreqentm but when I do, I do.  Actually, to be technically honest, I use the little strings at the ends of the pants, but the idea is the same.  It is actually the prescribed manner in which to wear one's uniform pants.
I was in a medium sized city (I think that it was about 80,000 then), but it was a pretty 'up-scale' school- mostly professor's/doctor's kids etc., which I think had something to do with it.  There weren't all that many people who were 'out' in high school, but there were some. Most of the time it wasn't really looked on as a huge deal- I think that when I was in grade 9 there had been 4 or 5 'movies of the week' about teenagers coming out to their parents, and that seemed to convince everyone that it was fairly normal. People would still get picked on, but pretty much to the same level as they would if they were a member of another minority- I actually got beaten up a lot more often for being a punk than I did for being bi :-) newlinechar  newlinechar I did know a few gay guys who got beaten up or harassed, but the real bullying seemed to be reserved for bi/lesbian girls.  Typical high school stuff- mainly catcalling in the hallways, getting pushed around, never getting asked to date, numbers written on bathroom walls etc. -nothing hugely major in the grand scheme of things, but at the time it was pretty difficult.  For years the running joke at our high school was that I was bi because I couldn't decide whether I was a guy or a girl (I was absolutely flat-chested, and that was pretty funny to everyone).  I think that there were about 10 girls at our school who were known to be bi, and I don't know one of them who ever dated a guy from any of the high schools in town because there was this huge stigma about it- the high school guys (thinking in retrospect) must have been hugely threatened by it.  So most of us dated guys from University, who had more of a 'don't ask/don't tell' mentality.  They didn't want to know about it unless it affected that relationship, whereas now they'd want full descriptions if not actual participation.  There were also support groups at the local University which high school kids could attend, and they were a lot of help, but pre-AIDS there was very little support given between the gay/lesbian/bi communities.  After AIDS arrived that got a little bit better as most of us volunteered at the local hospice, but before that there really wasn't much of a unified queer community.  newlinechar  newlinechar So it was a weird time- in hindsight (and after listening to other friends' stories) it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been, but it was still difficult at the time.  I'd like to think that kids who are coming out these days have it easier, and I think that they do.  My kids are in grade 8 and 9 now, and there are a good chunk of kids (higher than I'd expect) who already identify themselves as same-sex attracted/bi, with no consequences at all.  At least in our area, it really does seem to have gotten a bit better.  newlinechar  newlinechar 
On your bipolar friend-  newlinechar I feel your pain. I am currently a sophomore in school. Last year I met a junior who was a transfer student. The guy was quirky, witty, and a bit too much sometimes. It would be hard to chill/relax with him because because when we got together would always end up on the other side of the city, downtown, messing with people, and etc. (in retrospect he definitely had some kind of mental issue brewing, and for some reason I think our personalities would just click together kind of like two gears resulting in these bizarre situations. I was usually depressed and his vitality just did something to me...).  So I slowly I grew to appreciate his personality... But school became tough around finals and it was hard for me to spend time with anyone but myself and we slowly grew apart.  newlinechar  newlinechar ...Things didn't go quite well for him this year as he didn't return to school this year and he ignores all of my emails and all of my calls (I think he had his phone changed). The weird/sad thing for me is that his facebook account went inactive for awhile and we would always poke each other... well he had poked me last and when I went to poke him back he had disabled his account. This is what breaks my heart: fast forward 9 months later, now his account is restored (so I know he is alive out there, somewhere) but Facebook won't let me poke him back (he has some weird account settings). We have a lot of events at my school, looking back on it I should have attempted to hang out with him more. So sometimes when I am walking to class and I'm feeling lonely I just think about how much more I could have done to help him, or more time I could have spent with him.  But I've gotten better, I usually analyse how my friends think ( I am INTJ and I have developed some systems in my brain) and I have a friend now that I suspected of having a mental problem (he would just run around, invite me to hangout but end up talking to someone on Gchat kind of thing, and be really fidgety never really focusing on one thing, or conversation... This friend then told me how a bunch of his other friends had kind of abandonded him. He was thinking of leaving too! I thought gee I wonder why, but then I realized that these were classic symptoms of ADHD or acute anxiety. So I talked to him about it and encouraged him to see a psych he took my advice though and went to shrink about it and really enjoyed the experience) It's just sad for me because I want to reconnect with him but I can't, I am just hoping that next semester I see his happy little face and the adventures can continue again...

The idea was to provide a function similar to `eval`, as, say, `parse` which macros could utilise to invoke the parser on arbitrary text. Seeing as macros return a syntax tree, the `parse` function would also do so. I'm not sure whether the `parse` function should expand macros or give an AST as-is; maybe two functions are in order.

JSINQ is an implementation of LINQ to Objects and does not currently use indices (neither does the .NET implementation of LINQ to Objects btw.) As JSINQ is designed to work with any kind of data, it would be very difficult to implement indices. However, JSINQ is fairly optimized to begin with and because it is implemented lazily, queries have virtually no overhead up front (it's when you iterate over the result set that the query is actually executed). In my tests, JSINQ has performed really well even with extremely large data sets. You can check out http://kaijaeger.com/downloads/jsinq/playground/ to see for yourself.

&gt;The distinction between 'natural' and 'unnatural' is completely arbitrary. Termites build mounds; that's natural. Humans build sky scrappers; that's not.

Those with inelastic demand for a relatively commoditized product, likely the wealthier consumers willing to pay for convenience, will pay higher prices than the poor, moving closer to a system of [perfect price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination).  A vendor who is able to maximize producer surplus may then pass the extra profits along to the (poorer) consumer who will take the extra effort to bargain for a lower price.  The wealthy consumer will effectively subsidize the poorer consumer (and the vendor), and more products will be sold, allowing the manufacturer to capture the benefits of economies of scale. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Alas, the concept of bargaining is all but dead in America. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How many meals can the restaurant workers afford by a day's work? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is something for which it is very hard to find statistics.  The previously mentioned website does not apparently provide statistics on the cost of basic essentials; probably because economists adhere to the concept of purchasing power parity which dictates that prices should be the same everywhere for similar goods.  This is simply not the case, and price points have been growing apart for many years between Europe, America and Asia.  It is easy to examine per capita income and declare that Americans are eight times as wealthy as the Chinese, but my observations betray quite the opposite situation.

There weren't any primitive wars between homo sapiens and 'homo capensis' primarily because the Boskop race was a constructed idea dependent on systematic misclassification of large skulls. Homo capensis ultimately is homo sapiens. newlinechar  newlinechar http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/paleo/lynch-granger-big-brain-boskops-2008.html newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Ronald Singer (1958) reviewed the 'Boskop race' evidence as it existed by the 1950's. He concluded that there was no reason to maintain that any 'big-headed, small-faced group' had existed in prehistory, separate from the current biological variability of 'Bushman, Hottentot and Negro.' But that view is unsupportable -- in fact, what happened is that a small set of large crania were taken from a much larger sample of varied crania, and given the name, 'Boskopoid.' **This selection was initially done almost without any regard for archaeological or cultural associations -- any old, large skull was a 'Boskop'**. Later, when a more systematic inventory of archaeological associations was entered into evidence, it became clear that the 'Boskop race' was entirely a figment of anthropologists' imaginations. Instead, the MSA-to-LSA population of South Africa had a varied array of features, within the last 20,000 years trending toward those present in historic southern African peoples.

It's important to note that in Parkinson's, the neurons that die off are the dopaminergic ones, i.e. the ones that *produce* dopamine - the vast majority of the ones with dopamine *receptors* are not dopaminergic, and thus they are intact. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: misread post, apologies. newlinechar  newlinechar So what you're dealing with here is someone with low dopaminergic function, and highly upregulated D2 dopamine receptors, and you're giving them a dose of L-DOPA to bring their dopaminergic system's functioning to normal baseline levels. Except that it's already upregulated in limbic areas, and thus this will briefly behave like an 'overdose' until receptor levels renormalize. Until then, the mesolimbic circuit is in a hyperdopaminergic state, which seems to correlate with the state of the mesolimbic circuit in someone with schizophrenia where positive symptoms are both common and prominent. newlinechar  newlinechar I gave some citations for similar claims in my other post. If the OP has one specifically for general gullibility being increased in a medicated Parkinson's patient, and not just reward expectation, then I'd very much like to see it myself.

You type pretty good when you're drunk, especially considering how many multisyallabic words you had to spell correctly. I'm not entirely sure I understood everything in your reply, so I'm just going to sort of free-associate to what you wrote and see if I get around to talking about something of interest to you. :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Throughout the history of psychology, people have claimed that psychologists or psychiatrists are 'labeling' *different* but benign behavior as *deviant*, in an attempt to preserve the status quo (i.e., push everyone towards being 'normal') or in an attempt to preserve their power as 'experts.' While I think these ideas are extreme, every field needs external and internal critics who help those in the field take a good hard look in the mirror. For example, it's important for us to critically re-evaluate what we're considering a 'diagnosis', or for us to really think about why minorities and people in poverty are more likely to be diagnosed as psychotic, while the middle class white people who demonstrate identical symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed as bipolar.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, there are some incredible advantages to having diagnoses. For instance: (1) helps professionals communicate about what's going on with people, (2) helps us conduct research on disorders, which helps us know what the natural history and expected course of the disorder is, what other issues might go along with the disorder, and what brain structures or functions might be related to the disorder, (3) helps us develop treatments for the disorder, and (4) can provide the diagnosed person with some relief, validating what they may have suspected all along, letting them know they are not the only one with those issues, and letting them know that professionals are aware of and researching how to help people with similar issues if they want help.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It is hard to overemphasize these benefits. For example, if we didn't have a 'label' for the idea of psychosis, it would be difficult for medical researchers to talk to each other about the conditions associated with psychosis, such as tertiary syphillis (which is a pretty rare condition nowadays, but was once a more common, and more frequently overlooked, reason for psychosis). Part of how we figured out that the psychosis was associated with syphillis, in fact, is by comparing the behaviors shown by those with syphillis and those shown by those with psychosis unrelated to syphillis - they look a bit different. Because we had the diagnosistic entity of 'schizophrenia', we could compare the syphillitic individuals with schizophrenic individuals, see that they were different, and look for what else might be going on with the former group.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But, this example illustrates something that we do not acknowledge enough in our profession, which is: our diagnoses are always just our 'best guess' at the time. We are, and should be, continually trying to refine those diagnoses as we learn more about human behavior, neuroanatomy, neurodevelopment, and how the body and brain influence each other. Sometimes we seem as a a profession like we are trying to 'hide' this, as if it will make us seem less like we really know what we're talking about. But I think the public could actually be reassured by the idea that we want to continually refine what we know, and are willing to revise our diagnoses based on what we learn.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As a neuropsychologist, I tend to think *every* diagnosis is somehow 'medical', in the sense that it is related to the brain. [After one become a neuropsychologist, it's hard to even remember how one thought about disorders before - did I think that some psychological disorders were somehow not related to the brain, while others were? What sense would that even make??] This focus on the brain means that I don't really dissociate between 'medical' and 'psychological' diagnoses as much as other professionals might. In other words, I don't think that psychosis associated with syphillis is 'medical', but psychosis associated with schizophrenia is somehow 'psychological' and 'not medical'. To me, they are both brain-based - we just better know the cause of the brain dysfunction in the former case than we do in the latter case. But someday, I'm sure we'll understand more clearly what 'causes' the brain dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. newlinechar  newlinechar

Far from that. Virtually all people under forty speak some English but many of them caveman-style ('I go evening pub beer.') - enough to get their message across or help out a lost tourist but not enough to have a conversation. Teenagers and twentysomethings usually speak reasonably good English but don't be surprised if you run into one that doesn't.   newlinechar  newlinechar What I have noticed recently is that many people are able to communicate in English but they avoid it because they think their English is not good enough. I have a Norwegian friend who's lives in Prague and he says it can get really frustrating to constantly persuade people to speak and to reassure them.

People certainly like Bioshock for more than its graphics - give us a little credit. They created a great and unique world that doubled as a critique on a philosophical perspective, they made a game with RPG-like elements so you could customize your experience to some degree, and the plot itself was great (IMO). Yeah, the last boss was stupid, but thankfully it wasn't a deal-breaker (like KOTOR 2).

Oh no, I get that, and quite frankly I think that's a great way to think about films, however, personal emotional impact should not be your criteria when making a list entitled 'The best films of the decade.'

I consider it tens based solely on the fact that we name all the other decades (except for the 00s) based upon the second to last number in the year.

I had something similar happen. Someone called really early and woke me up asking for some name I didn't recognize. He seemed agitated and really wanting to talk to this person.

Immediately his tone changed to very aggressive and told me to not hang up and answer some questions or I would be raped (I'm a girl).

But I still can't act extroverted in unstructured social situations, like if I went to a bar alone and tried to just talk to people.

I assume you meant 'wouldn't it be more cost-effective to use ground-based solar installations'.  The answer is it depends on what you are trying to do with it.  If you want solar panels for your house, or for one power plant, then it absolutely is more cost-effective to use ground based.  At the current level of technology, in my opinion space-based only makes sense when you are talking about either  newlinechar  newlinechar * tactical military generation or disaster relief where the cost and time needed increasing the available power through ground-based stations would make it impossible in the timeframe required newlinechar * replacing the global power generation infrastructure, especially in technologically underdeveloped areas newlinechar  newlinechar In the first case, I don't know of any other technology that could conceivably allow us to deliver hundreds of MW to any area of the globe  in less than a day.  Consider what you could do with such an ability. newlinechar  newlinechar In the second and far more compelling case, global power generation, there are a number of things going for SBSP and a number of things going against ground-based: newlinechar  newlinechar * SBSP is suitable for base-load generation, since it is always on (in the case of geosynch satellites you get one day a year that they are in shadow)  Ground solar requires additional energy storage technology that is usually expensive, potentially dangerous, and not environmentally friendly, like huge tanks of molten salts. newlinechar * ground-based solar loses efficiency when it gets dusty, as high as [7% per month](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V1T-4980412-7S&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1151333779&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0b2aa4f588cf4ba36d1cf9d5b917416d)  rectenna farms for SBSP do not need to be cleaned to maintain efficiency. newlinechar * Massive ground-based solar installations fail at being environmentally friendly, since they put [thousands of acres of desert biome in the dark](http://www.physorg.com/news157617181.html)  Rectennas used for microwave generation can be mounted over existing agricultural land with no sunshade effect, since they are basically just a wire mesh. newlinechar * ground-based solar plans for base-load generation (replacement of coal in the US) usually involve massive installations in the southwest delivering power to the rest of the country.  The hidden cost that needs to be taken into account is the upgrade to the national power grid to enable this.  Estimates range, but they're all in the trillions of dollars.  The same goes for massive wind installations.  If you extrapolate this to the rest of the world, ground-based solar starts to look less and less like a replacement for fossil fuels and more like a niche technology.  SBSP avoids this issue by delivering the power locally anywhere in the world.  No enormous superconducting smart grids required. newlinechar  newlinechar It's an enormously complex issue, and I don't mean to gloss over anything.  There are lots of other issues I didn't discuss here.  I'm not claiming that SBSP is the way to go for future power generation (I think Thorium-fueled salt reactors could potentially get us there cheaper) but it's not as simple as saying that solar panels in space are just like solar panels on the ground but with an expensive rocket added. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Well depending on you city and time of day just having what appears to be a transfer will get you the go ahead. Here are a few nuances I've found: newlinechar  newlinechar Now certain cities don't print directional information on their transfer slips so as long as you have one in should be fine. Also I have very rarely seen a transfer slip that is good for an hour, The RFID card I'm using in Seattle has a two to three hour grace period. In Philly if I had a transfer that was wrong, as they do print information about direction and point of origin I just folded it up handed it over and got on outbound city buses to the suburbs and got off, and did the same for inner city transit. This obviously won't work on the subway 100% as it's a fare gate and they actually read them but during rush hour they usually just wave you through, These things are packed, people are in a hurry and they have a schedule to try and keep. newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover if you live in a city with actual working public transit,  I recommend just getting a monthly pass and using it for short trips on the weekend or commuting to work several times a week. newlinechar  newlinechar At worst you'll get get kicked off, get ticketed by transit police is rare as no driver is going to sit there and wait for them to arrive, IF worse comes to worse just act incredibly stupid. I mean sure you'll embarrass your self in front of that cute girl/guy you've been staring at reading that book you like, but were you really going to talk to her anyway? newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Act confident and pretend to shit bricks when needed.

Any harness and arrester is better than none. We've got a pretty inexpensive one, and it seems solid. newlinechar  newlinechar Beyond that, I can't claim to be an expert on climbing and safety gear, I just use it. My guess is that the more expensive gear uses lighter alloys in the couplings. Some may use heavier webbing, say to stop a multi-storey fall that a high-rise window-washer might experience. Some probably have some fancier features like padding or whatnot. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom line, I think you're fine getting a basic harness. The short line that clips onto the back of the harness should have a clip that is easy to operate--ours is a bit of a trick, and often requires two hands. The actual arrester is on the other end of that short line. Ours is a very simple cam with teeth that allows the rope to pass easily (well, semi-easily) in one direction, but bites down if pulled in the other direction. Then there's the long rope with a solid carabiner at the end to hook onto your anchor point. newlinechar  newlinechar Our ropes are plain, old heavy rope. There are fancier, lighter, thinner climbing ropes, but we just use heavy rope. newlinechar  newlinechar My girlfriend bought the whole rig. Let me ask her where she got it and I'll write again. She may have bought it used -- another good possibility. Unless there are visible runs, frays or tears, a used harness &amp; line from eBay may be a good way to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar (While it is *possible* that a reasonably new chimney would stop a fall, it just shouldn't be counted on. You're also likely to damage the chimney.)

In economic terms (ignoring political ideologies), socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production, not a redistributionist welfare state.  Therefore you can have a mostly capitalist nation with a large welfare state (like the countries you mention) and it not be particularly socialistic (again, in economic terms).

To clarify, 'stupid censorship' is not the same as 'censorship is stupid'. The comment is pretty clear about what makes this particular attempt at censorship 'stupid'. I'm tempted now to change it to 'dangerous censorship', because it offers no new solutions and gives an air of false security to anyone who doesn't understand its ineffectiveness. newlinechar  newlinechar To further clarify my point, I object to the Internet filter as proposed by Sen.

I would never *expect* a German or a Swede to be able to speak English.

There would almost certainly still be creditors - remember that companies don't have 'withholding' for company taxes, so the IRS would still be owed taxes at any point where bankruptcy protection is involked. Likewise entering bankruptcy would likely involve not having money to cover withholding and other debts to the employees. newlinechar  newlinechar As I said in the other reply to sw17ch, Gabe and Mike *could* shut up shop and walk away at any point while they're still in the black. It's unlikely any sane businessman would do that, but they could do it, and that is about the only circumstance where they could intentionally destroy a core asset (ie, shutdown steam and turn off the DRM) without it being a crime. I think the odds of that happening are only slightly above 'not a fucking chance' however. newlinechar  newlinechar Most likely if Valve ever do go under, Steam would end up being sold to EA or Activision, for steam users it likely wouldn't be the end of the world in the short term at least.

Often people from other cultures can't tell if an American is joking or not, or just aren't used to having certain things made fun of, and are offended. Americans in turn don't understand why they are offended, it's just a joke. For instance the comment someone made 'May I kindly offer your God a peanut?' I know he's just engaging in childish humor and ( probably ) means no harm , but a Hindu might not think this too funny. Did you go through a period of being offended by American humor?

The issue I have is that the entire case was built upon subjective witness testimony. It was essentially one half of town saying the defendant did it and the other half saying he didn't. When I saw that a case with absolutely no real evidence went to trial like this, I was just livid. newlinechar  newlinechar How do you convict someone for a severe charge such as murder and have absolutely no proof? There actually isn't any evidence to suggest the victim is even dead. Also some of the defense witness testimony directly contradicts the prosecution's testimony. Therefore, the jury obviously held the prosecution's witnesses in higher regard and totally ignored the defense's testimony. If I were on that jury, without being shown any evidence, I would be forced to acquit. I'm not going to convict someone simply because someone told me they did something.

In Quebec the toss up was between people flipping between the BQ and the Conservatives, again shooting down your 'progressives' argument. If anything the only strategic voting was by voters who wanted the Conservatives to have a minority, but still felt uncomfortable with a majority (whenever majority predictions came up, Conservative support would ease back) newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Though if Harper wouldn't have made the incredible arts funding blunder (where he said that Canadians don't support paying for rich people to have arts galas, which of course was paraphrased into 'Canadians don't like the arts!'), the Conservatives would have easily carried Quebec. That single blunder cost them a clear majority. newlinechar  newlinechar Put this in your pipe and think about it -- despite the 2/3rd 'majority', when polled on whether they wanted a coalition, the majority of Canadians said no way. It turns out that BQ voters didn't want the Liberals having the reigns of power, nor did the Liberals want the BQ to have considerable pull, or anyone allowing the NDP to call the shots. Despite this 'majority', most were more comfortable with the Conservatives continuing their run. newlinechar  newlinechar Kind of funny that. It turns out it isn't quite as simple. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be interesting if our votes allowed for a 'second choice' that would be weighted into the results. I suspect the results would differ dramatically from your analysis.

Why the hell is GP getting upvotes and your not?! newlinechar  newlinechar For the uninformed 'dymanic range compression' here has NOTHING to do with compression like mp3 used to reduce file size. newlinechar  newlinechar Volume normalization (at least in the sense that anyone involved with audio would use the word) simply makes sure that the highest peak of any digital recording is the maximum value possible. This is so you use the whole range of values for more fidelity. You can still have a very quiet passage and then a peak that uses the maximum value. newlinechar  newlinechar Dynamic range compression essentially makes sure that the peaks in any localised parts of the audio are pushed towards a certain value.  Basically it makes quiet bits louder and louder bits quieter, so you can hear an explosion and dialogue in the same recording and not be deafened. newlinechar  newlinechar You can only normalize the recording if you have the whole thing available to look for peaks. It does not solve the too loud to quiet problem. The program the op is suggesting would _is_ dynamic range compression, a problem that has been solved thousands of times. You get a little hardware box or program to do this.

I'm self-taught regarding neuroscience myself. I study mathematics (primarily analysis) and condensed matter/solid state physics, undergrad, third-year but it might as well be fourth-year considering the classes I typically take these days (and if you think that's random, my high school years were spent [cracking programs and writing viruses](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/aca82/i_am_a_former_reverse_engineervirus_writer_amaa/) ) newlinechar  newlinechar Story basically goes as follows: when I was 12 I discovered coffee...rapidly upped that habit to about 6 cups of coffee per day, then swapped to caffeine pills, I'd down 800mg/day, then third-year in high school I became friends with someone who was prescribed Adderall for his (potential? he seemed quite normal to me, attention-span-wise. Then again, looks can be deceiving when it comes to ADD, coping strategies can go a long way sometimes) ADD and hated it for whatever reason, and I basically wound up taking his prescription for him for my final two years of high school. We both went to different universities, and I spent my final month of that summer withdrawing off the stuff, but when you're using it as directed, withdrawal is basically nonexistent and consists of sleeping a lot for a day or two. Did my first year of college off amphetamines, did TERRIBLY in my first semester, better in my second. At the end of my third, by pure chance one of my roommates bought some of the pills illicitly to help him study, and asked if I wanted some. Sure, I went, realised what this was, was amazed at how well I owned the one exam I had them for, basically realised I needed this stuff. I knew that Adderall/Dexedrine were prescribed for ADD/ADHD, and so I hopped onto wikipedia to see what symptoms I needed to fake to get my hands on a prescription... newlinechar  newlinechar ...and noted that all but one of them (poor working memory - I've always had a memory that was better than average) applied to me. Much lulz resulted. A month later, a visit to the shrink resulted. Can't think of many things that were better for me, both personally and academically. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr: self-medicated, then self-medicated more, then stopped due to lack of supply, then self-medicated again, went onto wikipedia to see what symptoms I needed to fake to get said medication, realised I basically fit the description like a glove. Both lulz and facepalming occurred, as a result.

The matrix needs to define a transformation that takes in your old set of points and outputs the new set of points. The matrix you gave doesn't work for the point you gave - you can see this by using it to multiply the column vector for the point (2,2), i.e. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 2 2 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 4 4 newlinechar  newlinechar times newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 2 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 2 newlinechar  newlinechar which comes to  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 8 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 16 newlinechar  newlinechar i.e. the point (8,16). So the matrix you gave would map the point at (2,2) to (8,16), which is not (4,4). If you *did* want to map (2,2) to (4,4), you would need a different matrix (as it happens, the matrix *M* from my first comment would work, since it scales the x- and y-coordinates by a factor of 2). newlinechar  newlinechar In general I don't think the 'hit with a pool cue' analogy is a good way to think about things, because a transformation isn't just about what happens to a single point (i.e. a single ball), it's about the way a *shape* in the plane is changed, and most of the ways shapes can change (growing bigger or smaller, rotating around the origin, etc.) aren't really things you can do to a set of balls with a pool cue very easily. As an example of why it's not just enough to think about a single point, think of (2,2) as being the top right corner of the 2x2 square whose other corners are (0,0), (2,0), and (0,2). Then you could just shift the square up and to the right by 2 units, and the corner which used to be at (2,2) would now be at (4,4) ... but you could also scale up the square by a factor of two (i.e. exactly what the function *f* from my first comment does), which would also put that corner at (4,4), while doing *different things* to the other points of the square, e.g. (0,0) becomes (2,2) under the first transformation, but stays at (0,0) under the second transformation. So the fact that some transformation takes the point (2,2) to the point (4,4) is not enough for you to be able to say what transformation it is. newlinechar  newlinechar If you do want to write out a matrix representing a given transformation, the way to do it is to first write down a function which expresses the relationships you want, i.e. specify how the x- and y-coordinates of each new point should be derived from the x- and y- coordinates of each old point. So for example, if you wanted to flip the unit square across the y-axis, you could define your function to just negate every x-coordinate, i.e. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; x' = -x newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; y' = y newlinechar  newlinechar Then you can write this a little bit more explicitly as newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; x' = (-1)\*x + 0\*y newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; y' = 0\*x + 1\*y newlinechar  newlinechar which corresponds to the 2x2 matrix newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; -1 0 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  0 1 newlinechar  newlinechar because you can think of matrices as just a convenient way of writing down the coefficients of the x and y terms from the equations which describe the transformation.

&gt;no, it's pure speculation. newlinechar  newlinechar Alright, then I'll rant. newlinechar  newlinechar Something like 85% of American children get the full suite of childhood vaccines. Tap water usage rates are probably similarly high, if not higher. If these were the driving causes of autism, it's absolutely certain that lay American children would have autism rates similar to those in the children of engineers. newlinechar  newlinechar That this is not the case, then, suggests that engineers' children have a higher autism rate for a different reason. The argument for genetics is compelling, because autism is *(from the linked article)* 'unusually common even in the grandchildren of engineers.' Could it still be lifestyle choices? It absolutely *could* be, but it's a bit of a stretch to imagine that lifestyle choices could be passed down over two generations so consistently. It can't be ruled out yet, though. newlinechar  newlinechar But could it be the lifestyle choices you mentioned? Very probably not, because as I said, getting vaccinated and drinking tap water are incredibly common behaviors for average people, not just engineers. The difference in habit, if there is any, is simply not large enough to account for the difference in autism rates. newlinechar  newlinechar So why did you assume that this difference existed? Let me quote one of your other comments: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;are you saying mercury and fluoride aren't neurotixins? neurotoxins not associated with autism? newlinechar  newlinechar Your line of thought seems to be something like 'mercury and fluoride in vaccines and tap water are associated with autism, and engineers have higher rates of autism than lay people; therefore, engineers get more vaccines and drink more tap water than lay people.' The very next thing you should do is check to see if that conclusion is true! If engineers did drink more tap water and get more vaccines, it would be some decent evidence for your initial hypothesis. But since they don't, you should revise or abandon your hypothesis that mercury and fluoride are associated with autism. Perhaps they aren't. Perhaps they are, but engineers have a higher rate autism rate for some other reason. But whatever you conclude, be cautious. Check others' facts and theories, but check your own even more. I think you'll find that overall, it's a much more satisfying path to knowledge than unbridled speculation.

Read 'Here, there, and everywhere'. It's by the guy who actually recorded almost all of the Beatles' albums and therefore had a very good idea of what the heck he was talking about. John was alright at the beginning of their career, but towards the end he became a huge prick, and pretty much insane. He had Yoko in the studio for everything (which is a huge no no in music biz, it kills the flow), and even brought in a damned BED in which she lay in a nightgown and a tiara for the recording of an album. A bed. In the studio.  I also don't understand the George love here...he was a pretty shoddy guitarist until late in the band's career, learned to be a pretty good songwriter at around the same time, but wasn't exactly the nicest guy either (according to the book). Why does everyone think Paul has his head up his ass...? He made/makes great music, does a lot of charity work, and doesn't come off as an asshole at all in interviews. John did, and he was apparently a huge jerk (again, from the book, but I think that's a little more reliable than documentaries that focus solely on Lennon.)

Nope.  2XAA only doubles in one direction.  4XAA would be 1600x1200.  Also, here's tldr on Sc4Freak's thorough explanation:   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar MSAA is expensive, but not nearly as much as actually drawing at a higher resolution.  The real cost there is running the pixel shaders on 2/4/8x as many pixels.  MSAA skips that part.

That the conceptually simpler, more expensive version that matches everyones assumption.  The difference in quality is that MSAA only helps the edges of objects.

Even when you know it's a bubble, it makes financial sense to get on board if other people think the bubble is 'real'. That was my plan of attack at the time and it worked. newlinechar  newlinechar Austrians are fond of game theory and admit it's role in economic drivers such as spontaneous order. Games frequently have many equilibria involved. If there exists a “strategic uncertainty”, meaning the players aren’t certain how other players behave ... Multiple equilibria, both the beneficial and harmful, increases. newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, I think we can point to several events that facilitated the bubble. The CRA revision ... the dot-com bust, the Fed slashing rates to unnatural levels, interest rates and money freed up to lend unnaturally; and 'new operating procedure' that made financials view subprime/Alt-A and mortgage securitization as some kind of normal and customary thing. It isn't. It has existed for 30 years in all of humanity's history. newlinechar  newlinechar Once a bubble is established, it takes on a life of its own. At that point, everyone is to blame. With the sole exception of those who argue against the establishment of bubbles time and again. Austrians.

Comparing the theft of non-physical products to physical ones is a total non-sequitur. Just because an analogy with a physical product doesn't quite hold up doesn't mean it's not theft. If you take something which costs money, and you don't pay, then that's theft. Doesn't matter if it's a physical product, an experience or digital data.

This is, of course, an opinionated argument. I myself prefer the original release. While I respect Scott's vision, and I have an appreciation for the director's cut, the people who originally changed his movie to make it a little bit more palatable had a better idea of what would be liked by the masses. Which only makes sense, I'm sure at the time of the release of Blade Runner, Scott's producers had more experience at releasing movies that made money than he did. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as explaining things better, I'm not trying to cause friction with you, but I find it strange that you felt a movie without voice-overs explained more than the same movie released with them. I also find it a bit humorous, because that's why the production company put the voice-overs in to begin with. They felt the movie was less amorphous with them. Without them you have less of an idea of what's going on in the movie, because the information you're being fed is lessened without them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and the difference in cut scenes on the movie amounted to a 3 minute increase in running time in the 1992 version, and 4 minutes extra running time in the 2007 version. And I, like the production company, felt the one major scene that added the bulk of that time (The dream sequence in his apartment while Rachel played the piano) was... unnecessary. Plus gotta admit it, I miss the happy ending. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But in the end it all comes down to preference.
From [Wikipedia's article on the Emperor Shōwa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito#The_Sino-Japanese_War_and_World_War_II): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; According to Akira Fujiwara, the Emperor personally ratified the proposal by the Japanese Army to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5. newlinechar  newlinechar What this means is that there was genocide, for sure. But there was also forced slavery, forced sexual slavery, displacement of people throughout Asia, not only in China, but also in Korea and in other places where the Japanese invaded. Hirohito and his army weren't constrained by a particular race or religious view, as were the Nazis. [Some estimates put the Japanese body count at 10,000,000 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes). newlinechar  newlinechar So, Hirohito was, at least as bad as Hitler. However, Hirohito continued to rein after the war, his son is the current Emperor of Japan. And no one ever talks about the Japanese war crimes. I would say that this is worse than those names that have already been punished by a war tribunal (or, at the very least, punished by history), since Hirohito hasn't been punished in any way.

I know that MLA used to require it but it was updated in (I believe) the early 2000's as I began with MLA in 2003 and it didn't require it. I know that APA, Chicago and MLA don't require it, and as much as I know, those are the most widely used in Arts. I wrote both my undergrad and graduate theses in APA and didn't require it. The profs I've had have always been strict with format, to the point that I can usually write works cited in those three formats without looking to a style manual.

The [wikipedia entry on FAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_syndrome#Prevention) itself gives several excellent citations for what I said.

1. MJ has never killed anybody. Not even close. newlinechar 2. No medicine is for every body, but I never argued that it was. I argued that MDMA has more inherent dangerous side effects and would not be a good medication for vets due to its contraindications with other psychiatric medications and increased risk for Serotonin Syndrome. newlinechar 3. At the low doses necessary for medical benefit, meaning not getting stoned, marijuana works well for not only PTSD, but also pain relief. I only say this because I have used it for pain management in the past. 1/2 bowl in the morning, 1/2 bowl in the late afternoon. While that would not give me a but a buzz, it was enough to treat my pain. It is WELL documented that depression and pain are strongly inter-related. They even have medicines on the market that address this exact issue known as Cymbalta. In fact, in the pain management clinic I attend, they use antidepressants in combination with pain killers to address this very issue. I suggest you look up this topic, it is very interesting.  newlinechar 4. Marijuana is a natural drug, and for thousands of years, known to be safe. Even in high quantities. MDMA is a synthetic drug, only known for less than 100, and can be highly toxic even in low controlled doses, given the right circumstances. newlinechar 5. I have used pure MDMA, in powdered form, on several occasions. Great stuff for getting high, but I would not feel safe using it regularly to treat a psychiatric illness. Reason is that I also suffer from a depressive disorder and take meds for that. Taking the MDMA would always leave me feeling more severely depressed, especially so during the afterglow. This emotion is amplified because I already suffer from chronic depression, as does many other people that suffer from PTSD (especially fellow Vets).  newlinechar  newlinechar While it may have clinical use for the small handful of people that do not suffer from depression in combination with their PTSD (very small handful indeed), I stand by my statement that MDMA would not be a good first line drug for the treatment of it and that it's inherit dangers outweigh its benefits in this regard. newlinechar  newlinechar I have however read some great studies about using MDMA in clinical environments during therapy sessions in non depressives in that it opens people up, allowing them to talk more freely about their issues.   newlinechar  newlinechar For more information on the medicinal use and history of MDMA, I recommend picking up a copy of Pursuit of Ecstasy. It is a great and well informed read.  newlinechar http://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Ecstasy-Experience-Studies-Alcohol/dp/0791418189 newlinechar  newlinechar I read it a few years back when I was 'studying' the use of the drug ;).

This came into effect on January 1st, 2009.

Honduras total export revenue was $6billion in 2008, of which [62% of that was from the US](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html).

the problem is that the movie industry isn't just making business decisions &amp; changing their product.  they're trying to get the government to create regulations which would have far reaching implications for fair use laws and privacy laws.

We were together for a little over four years (when I was 17-21). I was still going to school working at a supermarket at the time, and we were both very naive to the ways of the world. She grew up in a strict household with foreign parents who pressured her to get married all the time, because in her parents country it is common for girls to get married when they are younger than 18, so at the age of 21 she was seen as a 'failure' for not being married. Her parents also didn't know I exist (during all four years) because I am a white american guy and she said they would never approve. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that I now go out whenever I want for however I want, I've dated interesting and fun people, and can focus on my career, I'm satisfied with my decision looking back on it. And I still look forward to enjoying at least another few more years of freedom before I settle down.
I used one of those in the past when I had cheaper bras when I was willing to risk a $40 bra having a wire warped or something. I also use them now for delicates such as underwear. But, having dropped up to $350 on a particular bra, I don't mind taking the bit of extra time once a month to make sure nothing is going to happen! They're also mostly delicate lace and such, so I'm just afraid to chance it considering at a time, I'm washing roughly $2000 worth of bras.
I set up greylisting for a time in about 2006 and saw a big drop in our SMTP servers CPU loads.  I removed it again a couple of years ago because our users were complaining about delayed messages.

Some googling led me to this [article](http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2009/04/15/germany-to-join-other-european-countries-in-ban-against-monsantos-genetically-modified-mon-810-corn/) (not sure if they're a credible source). What I gathered from this and other sources, GM food was mostly banned in Europe until 2004, when they allowed a certain corn strain. Even then individual countries had the power to ban it. In any case, Europe doesn't have huge subsidies on corn (I think), so they probably have to use real sugar in their food.
The point isn't whether or not humans are rational (clearly, we're not). The point is how well do simplified rational models capture the phenomena we are interested in and what things are we leaving on the table. Some economists are insane and will stick blindly to the idea that people *are* rational, but I think most will agree that rational models are just good because they're simpler and easier to work with. In some cases they're enough, in many others, they're not. That's why we do lab experiments in behavioral, it gives a nice environment to test these things.  newlinechar  newlinechar An interesting question for you: newlinechar Suppose you are an oil company and the government is auctioning off a tract of land that is known to contain oil.

It'll cost you $Y to get it all up to the surface and any profits are good profits. How much would you bid in the oil tract auction?

You're creating the false analogy here. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're comparing 'piracy' (Creating copies of digital media and sharing it not-for-profit) to REFUSING PAYMENT for a service to which you are CHARGED. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Piracy is a lot more like someone else who already OWNS a movie (paid for it with legal tender) letting you WATCH it.  Which is in no way morally wrong or illegal. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you purchased something, its yours to do with as you damned well please. If that means giving it to a friend in a digital format, it is in no way the responsibility of the product BUYer to 'mystically understand' that there are ways in which this CD should not be used. At no point did the buyer knowingly sign any contract or enter into any agreement stating that there were ways in which the product that they paid money for could not be used. The exception to this is if they created a machine that produced copies for the sole purpose of selling those copies in a way that would compete with a company already selling that product.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If any 'unintended usage' of a product becomes the legal concern of person buying that product, then anyone who has ever bought a spoon and used it as a fork should probably watch their back because they're infringing the copyrights of the fork company! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar How a company wishes the product that they produce and sell 'As is'  to be used, is and will continue to be the concern of the product maker.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In regards to your OWN false analogies... newlinechar Taking massages as an example: If you go get massage AND PAY FOR IT, and then learn something there, then decide to give your friend a massage for free, is what you 're doing morally wrong? No.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Granted, one could argue that if you do it for the sole purpose of stealing that companies secrets, with the intention of creating your own business to MAKE MONEY, then it would be 'Morally wrong' and illegal. This is however, not even remotely what 'piracy' is. It is however, something that big companies do all the time. Yet I fail to see your outrage in that regard.

Uh, could you please be a bit more specific? 'In terms of culture' is so broad I don't even know where to start. I'll try, but no guarantees:   newlinechar  newlinechar Bohemia is the biggest, most diverse and most atheist part. Its northern and northwestern is notorious for mining of brown coal (and consequent pollution and devastation of the countryside), organized crime, prostitution etc. Three of the four Czech national parks are in Bohemia. Central Bohemia tends to attract people from all over the country because they move to (or close to) Prague to work and/or study. I think it's because of all these diverse influences that Prague has very little distinct folk culture of its own - I've never heard of a folk song or a traditional food recipe that originated in Prague for example.   newlinechar  newlinechar Moravia is largely agricultural and famous for wine, if anything. Pretty wide array of dialects is spoken in Moravia and the one around Zlín is said to be the closest to standard Czech. Brno (the capital) has an extremely high ratio of college students to general population.   newlinechar  newlinechar Ostrava (the capital of what is generally considered the Silesian part although the city is partly Moravian) was known as the 'steel heart of the republic' in the communist times. Everything that has to do with coal and iron is there - mines, steel mills, foundries, coking plants, you name it. A lot of it has been closed down after the revolution though. The people in this area are known for their Polish-influenced dialect, crude humour and ability to consume incredible amounts of alcohol of a questionable origin.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's always beer in Bohemia, wine and slivovitz in Moravia and mostly vodka in Silesia. Every tourist guide will tell you that the people in Moravia are more welcoming, generous, friendlier and whatnot but I could never tell any difference in Bohemia.

I'm under the impression that history class in American schools is very u.s.-centric... correct me if I'm wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from the two world wars I didn't learn about 'recent' (let's say 1800-now) German history until I was in an advanced history class in 12th and 13th grade (in Germany you have to pick 2 courses to focus on during these years). And even that was more about all the secret diplomacy going on in Europe and the events that eventually lead up to WW1. The rest was ancient Greece, Egypt, the roman empire, China, America... I think each country needs to concentrate on its own history first, but it shouldn't take *most* of the time. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. newlinechar  newlinechar Very true, but unfortunately many people completely miss the target when trying to apply their knowledge. Just think of the number of times you saw something being compared to nazi germany (or someone to hitler) in a way totally disrespectful to its victims. It has been an overused meme for a while now... newlinechar  newlinechar Soon we'll start telling the story of the American politician who cried hitler.

Absolute rot. The HRA was passed in 1998, Britain has been in the EU for far longer than that. The EU maintains entry standards which relate to national human rights, but those certainly wouldn't apply to a country that joined half a decade ago. The ECHR isn't even connected to the EU; it's a totally separate treaty passed before even the EEC, and several ECHR signatories are not and have never been EU members. Finally, all the HRA really did was stop Law Lords making rulings they knew were going to be successfully appealed to the ECHR. You don't need specific domestic legislation to enforce Convention rights outside of whatever authorised the Convention in the first place.

No, as waffles said earlier. People just don't 'give' money for an organization, people like to see some sort of action being done, and in this case playing video games works.

&gt;don't deprive me of a natural resource on my land  newlinechar  newlinechar As others have pointed out, in most places in the US (I don't know about Canada) you don't own the rights to anything under your land... you ownership goes down a few feet only.  When you buy a big piece of property you often have to pay a lot extra for the mineral rights, or you can't get the mineral rights at all, some corporation has them and could, in their, mine *your* land. Because they are really mining *under* your land. newlinechar  newlinechar But anyway, in this case, the resource was not *on* his land, it was under it, and the laws in the US (and perhaps Canada and elsewhere) make a big distinction about that.

Well, it sounds like it requires installation of software, which Tiddlywiki doesn't.  Tiddly wiki is platform agnostic, since you just need a browser that supports java.  Put it on a thumbdrive and you can take it with you anywhere and use it on any pc/mac/linux box with a standard browser and java.  It's also supported with a wide array of plugins that do all sort of things (admittedly, almost none of which I've found any need to use, so I can't really argue for their usefulness), and has an option to autosave to a new file with a date/time stamp (so it's not overwriting) after any change, which makes it far less likely that you'll lose a day's worth of work.  I don't really know how many, if any, of those features Kabikaboo has going for it - I saw a lot about branching nodes, but that's pretty easy to accomplish in TiddlyWiki since it's basically a pocket-sized wiki. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.tiddlywiki.com/

Actually it does.

Because it's a dick thing to do? newlinechar  newlinechar Woah now, don't go reaching for that down arrow just yet, let me try explain; newlinechar  newlinechar When you visit a site, you're getting content that somebody has spent money on. Maybe not much, but at least some. As some people don't all live with their parents, they'll need to pay for stuff (like the server). Sometimes they get money through merchandise, sometimes they can have an awesome community and investment money like Reddit to support them. Some even stick up a big 'no entry unless you pay me $5' barriers. There are many business models. newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the time though, people make their money back through advertising. This means that the cost you pay to get the content they paid for is that you have to see their adverts. If the cost is too high (a billion shitty adverts, for example) then you should just not go back to that site. newlinechar  newlinechar Using AdBlock is like pirating a movie IMHO.

Even at size 6, women are not shaped the same.  At size 16, they are not shaped the same as each other, either.  It's impossible for a designer to make one pair of pants that fits everyone, even if they do use 'wide' and 'petite' to somewhat tailor the clothing.

If there's one finding in economics that I think is both theoretically and empirically strong it is that *given appropriate conditions* (ie, not too much market power, distributed knowledge, heterogeneity) market mechanisms (properly designed) are very very very very very good at aggregating the information of the participants. There's a large literature on how to design markets like this both in the computer science and economics journals. newlinechar  newlinechar Markets are tools, and so in some cases prediction markets can work very well (InTrade and the Iowa political prediction markets beat the pundits all the time). I think more companies and governments should use them to help decentralize a part of the information gathering/dm-ing process. Again though, there can be problems and it is a case-by-case basis on when they can and can't be effective. I think *The Wisdom of Crowds* oversells them a little bit, but definitely does a good job in pointing out when they could be useful and the necessary conditions for them to work. newlinechar  newlinechar Yiling Chen at Harvard is the first name that comes to mind, she's a computer scientist who works on this stuff.

It's a space-inefficient way of generating the powerset,  for example `length (powerSet [1..32])`  will leak copious amounts of memory in a hurry.

This in turn changes the order in which the subsets are produced: newlinechar  newlinechar     powerSet  'abc' == ['abc','ab','ac','a','bc','b','c',''] newlinechar     powerSet' 'abc' == ['abc','bc','ac','c','ab','b','a',''] newlinechar  newlinechar The orderings are analogous to counting in binary,  with the original definition having the least significant bit at the end of the list,   whereas the revised versions have the least signficant bit at the beginning: newlinechar  newlinechar     pow      pow' newlinechar  newlinechar     000 *    000 *  newlinechar     001      100 *  newlinechar     010      010    newlinechar     011      110    newlinechar     100 *    001 newlinechar     101      101 newlinechar     110      011 newlinechar     111      111 newlinechar  newlinechar Both solutions have maximal sharing among the tails of the sublists,  but the second solution arranges the sharing so that shared sublists appear adjacent to each other in the overall order,  as illustrated by the asterisks.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you really want to preserve the order in which subsets are generated,  in most cases you will be *much* better off not sharing sublists and fully recomputing each list instead.   newlinechar  newlinechar You can further improve on this definition:  instead of computing all the subsets of a finite set,   you can compute all the finite subsets of a (possibly infinite) set.   `Data.List.subsequences` includes this enhancement,   and there was some discussion of this on the [libraries mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2007-December/008788.html).

This one has it's own peculiar quirks. I think I like the overall contraption the most of all 3. The opacity of the box maintains the allure of mystery, while the hand inside shows an obvious attention to detail. newlinechar  newlinechar I do have two complaints though. The ornateness of the box along with the appearance of the hand give this contraption a somewhat sinister look, while the earlier (in order of my viewing) renditions are more lighthearted. I also appreciate the music from the first video, which is lacking in the animated GIF.
I addressed the 'ignoring things' issue with another commenter who shared the same concern.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/akjab/obama_hires_his_first_transsexual_amanda_simpson/c0i202x) is the permalink.

&gt; The reason is that your left/right wing bifurcation is simlistic sophistry. It's a myth purveyed by people who think that there's the conservatives, and then 'everyone else' suffering from horrible vote splitting. newlinechar  newlinechar Where on the voting map were the conservatives prior to the unification?  STFU. newlinechar  newlinechar While there clearly are differences between various progressive parties (just as there were between Alliance and Reform, as you'll recall), it's obvious to everyone but the thickest idiot that Liberals, NDP, and BQ represent progressive political thought.  Buzz Hargrove encouraged NDP-ers to vote strategic and was kicked out of the party and practically disowned.  NDP voters failed to heed his call and now we're stuck with Harper. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Put this in your pipe and think about it -- despite the 2/3rd 'majority', when polled on whether they wanted a coalition, the majority of Canadians said no way. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason people were against the coalition was because they're ignorant and Harper took advantage of that, using attack ads to paint the coalition as somehow unconstitutional.  The reality, of course, is that government is formed by whoever has the confidence of the largest number of MPs, and parties aren't officially part of the process at all.  Using electorate's ignorance combined with slimy politicking is Harper's MO, as he has proven time and again. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It would be interesting if our votes allowed for a 'second choice' that would be weighted into the results. I suspect the results would differ dramatically from your analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, I think *you* would be the one who'd be surprised by the results.  Conservatives could at best carry Alberta, and perhaps a few rural ridings in Ontario and Quebec.  You'll see that as soon as LPC gets rid of that carpet-bagging patrician cunt and elects a real progressive leader dedicated to public service.

Eh... I don't understand the guys downvoting you for sharing exactly what you're feeling. My wife does not understand why men do it at all either, and to be honest, I think it's just a difference in hard wiring. I'm not saying it justifies doing things I know that would hurt my wife but... it's innate for me to want to let off some pressure and just have that split second of peace and calm after I've done my thing. newlinechar  newlinechar People seem to say that we should embrace all of our natural urges, but I think it's an over-reaction to an overly-strict Victorian or religious based view of sex. If we released all our natural urges, we'd shit in our pants. We provide bounds for our urges to benefit our good. I don't want to waste my urges on a video when they end up leaving my wife with nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I don't think porn in all forms and uses necessarily leaves your wife with nothing, it definitely short changes her if you're denying her because you just beat off, but in some cases it may be what you need the same way a woman needs to do things that I find to be a waste of time and money. Too many of my married friends will go without sex for weeks, sometimes months on end. However, I would not equate my wife's shopping to my porn viewing.

Peerguardian (and the opensource alternative PeerBlock) rely on blocking known IPs.  If you think the known IPs are the only ones being used by those seeking to protect (the other kind of) IP, you're being foolish.  I found PG and PB to work pretty well in blocking malware vectors, though not enough to keep using either.  In the short term, using either will make you slightly harder to detect, as there are enough people not using them to fill the quotas (just an expression) without needing the next step.  In the medium term, as more people use them, it will  become commonplace to use home network IPs of employees and other avenues that hide the intent of the user, the IP police.  And therefore in the long term they will become utterly useless for that purpose.

It doesn't matter if he's wrong about the degree of stimulus. It doesn't really contradict the main thrust of his ideas. That's the point. It's like... Imagine you believe raising the price of an item will lead to more income and I believe the way to go is lowering the price. And then for whatever reason we end up lowering it. It's easy for me to toss in a 'I'm not sure we lowered it enough' and still be 'right' if things go my way. Because either way we're not raising the price.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah you're right.. I can't prove he does it on purpose. There's no way to. I merely suspect him because he's such a partisan political hack.
&gt;ToI has the largest circulation in the country. newlinechar  newlinechar But still thats not even the whole share of the population which reads an english daily.
I use the 960px as well. Most of my sites use this and many of my web designer and developer followers on Twitter do this. Here's the deal. It divides nicely and evenly into columns, and gives you the max width that still gives some semblance of a left and right border on a 1024px width display that has a scrollbar on the window turned on. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if I'm doing mobile work, then I use WURFL to detect a mobile, redirect the person to a .mobi domain, and then use fixed width 260px XHTML-MP, minimal features, PNG images no larger than 250px, minimal images and mostly CSS styling, short pages, and iPhone-app-ish nav buttons at the bottom of pages. newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, the Blackberry gateway converts GIF and JPG images into PNGs according to the developer docs. This sucks because sometimes JPGs and GIFs compress smaller than PNGs, but oh well. So that's why I do everything mobile in PNGs now. newlinechar  newlinechar But anyway, back on topic, if I do use the 960px width format, I do not use any frameworks anymore. Those add bloat. Instead, I have learned tricks of the trade for cross-browser, strict, valid, XHTML/CSS that even works with IE6. And as far as height, I make pages around 1024px height on average, but try to model as much of the excitement as possible in what people see on these wide laptop screens, accounting for browser tabs, an extra couple browser toolbars people may have, and so I usually try to get that excitement into 600px height. And I have come up with a term for this. I call this the 'foldspace'. Even though people say there is no such thing as a fold on PCs and laptops with scrolling pages, there really is from the standpoint of marketing, where you need excitement in pixels people see on the page before they even scroll, before they even go 'meh' and click over to another site.

&gt; Just think of the number of times you saw something being compared to nazi germany (or someone to hitler) in a way totally disrespectful to its victims. It has been an overused meme for a while now... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Soon we'll start telling the story of the American politician who cried hitler. newlinechar  newlinechar Very good point. However, I think when it comes to extreme forms of government such as fascism that there is no such thing as 'too careful'. We need to keep from resorting to that ever again. newlinechar  newlinechar I do, however, understand your point about the Nazi Germany parallel. Hitler has become something of a boogeyman in Western culture. Whenever something is bad, compare it to Hitler. newlinechar  newlinechar American History classes are fairly U.S-centric. I didn't learn any real history from Kindergarten (might recognize that word, basically the first level of education or '0th grade') until 5th grade. In the 5th and 6th grade were all the basics: the U.S Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and so forth. History is lumped in with 'Social Sciences' in the U.S curriculum. Granted, before that we learned things like 'Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492', but there was no mention of his endorsement by the Spanish or the other conquerors who hit Latin and South America. Cortez, de Francisco and all the others came up in 7th grade (8th grade by German standards). newlinechar  newlinechar We didn't learn about what lead up to WWI, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by the Serbian mercenaries was only a passing subject in my 9th grade history class (I believe that's the equivalent of the first year before the German 'Gymnasium'). In 9th grade my class focused on 'World History', which was really only history since the early 1800's. newlinechar  newlinechar 10th grade was 'American History', we learned about James Madison, the war of 1812, all the shit that isn't really prevalent in common knowledge of American History. newlinechar  newlinechar I certainly agree that a basic understanding of the home country history is important. In the case of America, there's only so much that you can talk about. In America, at least in my schooling, there was no mention of Australia, the history of Africa, ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, Persia, ancient China, or Russia. All it is is American and *some* European history. It's a shame, really. The only reason I have a semi-working knowledge of world history is because I sought it out on my own.

Very few people (relatively speaking) have any experience with creating things that can be infringed upon so they lack the reference to understand the impact. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am a photographer and a web developer and have a pretty good handle on how it affects me when someone infringes on my work.

No, I haven't read it, but I will certainly add it to my reading list.  Thank you so much for doing this and for your thoughtful answers.  I owe a great debt to your field.  After a neurologist *yelled* at me that people my age don't have memory problems like what I was describing unless they had brain tumors and he would KNOW if I had a brain tumor--I couldn't have an MRI due to my cardiac device so he had to use his x-ray vision  :-p  --the GOOD docs on my treatment team sent me off to a renowned neuropsychologist for extensive testing to evaluate possible damage from my recent concussion.  As it turns out, the pattern in my deficits points to a rather focal region in my left temporal lobe, which was consistent with the history of the concussion(s).  The testing was painful in a way; it was very stark when we hit upon the things which I can no longer do well, perhaps much moreso than in day-to-day life because the skills were in isolation with no way to cheat/compensate with things I still can do well.  But it was also validating to have an explanation, and it helped me to form better coping strategies.

&gt;Cats can just display it better and are more interesting to look at in a picture or video. newlinechar  newlinechar That's it, really. Both animals are very social (despite the popular belief that cats are anti-social -- even feral cats live in clowders and have complex social systems). It's just that, while humans understand dogs' social cues rather easily, cats are a bit more enigmatic. It took me a while to realize that one of my cats wasn't an asshole, but was actually just really playful and neurotic -- he likes knocking things over because he wants me to chase him around, not because he wants to ruin my day. So, while I still give him a little tap on the head to tell him that I don't like what he did, I then give him a hug and a pet to let him know that I'm still his friend. Ever since I realized this, he's become much, much more affectionate -- and much less of an 'asshole.' He now understands what games I like and what games I don't like, and, more importantly, that I *do* like to play, that I'm not simply here to yell at him and occasionally give him food and water. newlinechar  newlinechar Having a cat is less effort in the sense that they're much easier to care for (they mostly care for themselves), but more effort in the sense that you have to develop your relationship with them and learn how to effectively communicate with them. Otherwise, you won't have a companion, you'll have an animal who lives with you because you feed it. If you work at it, cats can be great, low-key, pleasant companions who show a lot of affection. newlinechar  newlinechar As a caveat, I've had both cats and dogs and love both in their own ways.

2months in southeast asia is maybe enough to do 3 countries. Four is probably pushing it. Personally I'd skip out on singapore (unless really need to see a another first world country that speaks english?) and its logical to omit malaysia. Laos is really really boring other than one major cool backpacker hang out in Vang Vienne(google this +tubing) and a waterfall you should climb to the top of in Luang Prabang (this pic doesnt do the view justice, not many people find this spot either: http://www.mattandbeckysminiadventure.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/luang-prabang-waterfall-montage.jpg ) The capital is boring. A flight from Chang Mai Thailand -&gt; Hanoi is a great way to save time as laos is a bit bleh.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I was travelling for 9 months I'd probably do SEA and Oz. I don't really know if it would be realistic for me to be able to get in much more than that(and even that would be rushed). Because take that step back to look at what you're saying, you want ~5 months in Oz and listed up to 10 other countries you'd want to get into and out of in the span of four months. I couldn't make that work in any way other than a 'now I can say I've been there' sort of a way. Getting from place to place takes time and a lot out of you, I think you'd be surprised by the amount of down days where you just chill and read a book in the sun you'll find yourself wanting to take. And if the whole point of this trip is to experience life in a different land and culture, you should take those days. People watching, deep breaths, and hopping on the cheap local bus with no other (presumably) white people just to see where it goes.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is all from my own perspective though right, but your actual travel costs (as in moving from one spot to another) (alongside and booze/drugs/onceinalifetimesque) are where a large chunk of your budget goes, and its generally not the enjoyable part (and trying to do something major the day after a 12 hour bus ride is balls). newlinechar   newlinechar In Oz you can expect to be spending ~25€ per day most likely and that's with cooking a lot of your own food, cool shit and binge drinking and location changes (melb-&gt;syd etc) not included.  newlinechar In South East Asia I'd say a fair budget would be ~6-7€ with the same restrictions as above. newlinechar  newlinechar If you really only want to do the cities you mentioned, then I'm sure you can sort something out, but I wouldnt want to (for example) go to Syria and ONLY go to Damascus.

Yes, I didn't go into the details here, since I understood the thread to be about whether or not people had non-mainsteam beliefs that they didn't bother discussing. I only gave enough description to illustrate that my beliefs were probably out of the U.S. mainstream of thought. newlinechar  newlinechar If what we want is a safe, just, civilized society, then we have to do what's necessary to get what we want. We've got 7 million citizens on probation and we've got over 2 million behind bars—those numbers alone speak to a colossal systemic failure. What I would do instead would be to: newlinechar  newlinechar * Approach the issue of controlling violence and crime through scientific means, which would include identifying and mitigating the root causes of antisocial behavior. newlinechar * Make sure that all law enforcement and corrections policy and practice decisions were reviewed and approved by qualified social scientists. newlinechar * Ensure that the actual incarceration of truly dangerous people be devoted entirely to providing skills and experiences in working authentically in a functioning social system. newlinechar * Restructure prisons to be much more like rehabilitation centers and much less like concentration camps. newlinechar * Provide the large majority of violent prisoners who are actually mentally ill with appropriate treatment and care, and, if truly necessary, a safe, dignified, and meaningful separation from larger society. newlinechar * Reverse all privatization of law enforcement, criminal justice, and corrections operations and place all such operations solely under public control. newlinechar * Decriminalize activities such as prostitution and drug use, and limit prison sentences only to people who pose a clear, present, and persistent danger to society (*e.g*., sexual predators, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Bernie Madoff). newlinechar * Elevate law enforcement and corrections work in stature, compensation, benefits, and education. newlinechar * Abolish all mandatory sentencing at all levels. newlinechar  newlinechar There's more to this—much more—but this is the general drift of my belief.

Look at the holes in the official 9-11 story, then look at the undconditional, unquestioned *empirical* explanations Wikipedia provides for why, once in the entire history of 20th century architecture, sky scrapers in excess of 50 stories fell as the result of jet crashes and subsequent burning of office materials. 247 acutely selected footnotes chosen to create a very specific impression, yet you read the footnotes and they aren't really that reputable for what we know of current info. The second one is a CBS news report which CBS, itself, was initially 'redacting' portions of.

I know for a fact conspiracies attract the tin-foil hat crowd--my own views on holoscience make me part of that crowd--and if it's a fact, it should be reported as such. My beef is with casting 'emprical' that which, aside from the corporate media's effort to 'create reality' in a sort of George Berkeley way (without Berkeley's insistence on God, perhaps), really has never been empirally proven.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Fact 1: conspiracies attract persons who, if their other beliefs are not irrational, have little consideration for how their beliefs affect the intended audience. In real-world studies, you would have to go to torturous lengths to create a dismissal of this.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Fact 2: September 11th has never been proven to be exclusively an outside job.

To add on to rainfall's comment, it is worth noting that in some Swiss cantons, women were not allowed to vote until the 1990s!  Also Kuwait =/= Muslim world. newlinechar  newlinechar As fundamental as I believe universal suffrage is (remember while white women could vote in 1920s black men and women were systematically disenfranchised for decades more in the USA) it often seems like the metric of women's suffrage is extrapolated to mean way too much.  Is Liechtenstein (1984) less progressive than Yemen ('60s and 70s)?  Are Portugal, Jordan and Bangladesh all about the same?  Is Azerbaijan a couple years more advanced than the USA?  newlinechar  newlinechar Women's suffrage can come sooner from a dictator who thrusts it on their populace or it can be delayed by a powerful minority coalition partner that needs to be appeased.  Either of these would distort the significance of the arrival of women's suffrage.  newlinechar  newlinechar Interestingly, often when women first gain the right they often vote for the more conservative parties (i.e., those that had worked hardest to block the implementation of that right).

`flip` is very useful (and not at all hideous) because in Haskell, functions are [curried](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) by default; but not all function have a 'best' ordering of arguments.

An increase in the money supply is and will always been neutral - meaning, there is no prosperity gain or enabled by an increase in the _supply_ of money. People don't need to 'go out and find' new gold, rather, goods become more populated in comparison to gold overtime (and gold-tied notes), which is what we would call an increase in the purchasing power of the dollar. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I've always thought the reason the online games didn't want the money to have value outside of the game is because then they would become... newlinechar  newlinechar You've already missed the mark. Things do _not_ have value. Value is not a feature of a thing, rather, it is the importance an individual assigns to it. A game company cannot force any 'value' for anything. Some people might trade a PB&amp;J sandwich for 5,000 WoW gold pieces, while others might actually pay 5,000$. As for banking regulations, no, they would not be forced to regulate their currency - it would just be considered another commodity. The Fed doesn't care if you just _give your money away_, the idea is that you spent it (or from an Austrian perspective, you willingly paid for a good or service, donation being a service of internal happiness). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It would slow down growth: adding a new server would require not only the physical cost of the server but a financial obligation equal to the reserve value of all the treasure you are planning to spawn. newlinechar  newlinechar Because WoW isn't saying 'we're a bank!', the Fed has no reason to demand any reserves. It is a free market currency, in that one private group can do anything they want with it whenever they want. However, if they commonly gave out 5 billion gold coins to their friends and families, normal players wouldn't be able to buy any items (and the game would lose players). This is how free enterprises are regulated by the market. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In some ways this is a good metaphor for why it is difficult for an economy to grow with a gold standard: it's far easier for a central banker to flip a switch and mandate that new money was found than for people to have to be fortunate and find it. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, no one has to find gold. There is a misconception that 'more dollars' equals 'more prosperity'. Dollars are just paper - it is the _purchasing power_ of a dollar that brings prosperity. Thus, a private bank may offer private bank notes, which would allow quite arbitrary liquidity increases whenever needed. The regulation comes in the fact that said bank must still be respected enough to have its notes honored. They cannot invade Iraq, to put it simply, because people would just turn in the notes all at once. When we are _physically unable_ to turn in our notes, like we are in the U.S., it allows the 'central' bank to do whatever they want - for instance, to fund an occupation and to increase government power at home. newlinechar  newlinechar As wtfftw pointed out above, the wiki article on the [subjective theory of value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) is a great place to start.

Avatar Cryer's Anonymous, Group hug! newlinechar  newlinechar Related story: I also went to watch it a second time, and I hardened myself to not cry, and intentionally sat at the end of my group of friends so that they were all to my left. Some girl who was part of her own group of friends sat to my right. This girl starts having those crying breathing spasms at the emotional sections of the movie, and it makes it even harder for me to stop tearing up. I'm also sweating buckets for all the fight scenes, because I'm emotionally filled with rage and the desire to bullrush some mechwarriors. The movie ends. The crying girl next to me, she and I both stay seated there while both of our respective friends immediately jump up to stand in line to file out of the theatre. She was really crying really loud during those quiet emotional scenes so she has to know that myself and everyone around her had heard. So I try to make things cool by being honest and admitting to her: 'I cried hard the first time I saw this. If you don't tell anyone, I won't tell anyone. (smile)'  And she like fell into my arms... And I was like woah.... Okay... And then we laughed and gushed about how great of a movie it was. And this whole time its dark and stuff so I have no idea what she looks like, so then the lights slowly come on, and she takes her giant 3d glasses off and I realize for the first time she's kind of bombshell-ish. And I'm then like WHOA.

&gt;&gt;    Problem 1: Where did the 'cheap' money come from? (Hint: it wasn't the GSEs) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah, I know. The cheap money mostly really started ramping up from Greenspan's rate cuts to facilitate a bubble after the tech sector collapse. It does predate and postdate that though, but that's the real moment they had to do the right thing, if I had to pin it down. newlinechar  newlinechar Problem 1.1. The administrations statements on cutting the Fed rate had to do with the ownership society as well as the recession.  Greenspan did not cut the rate to 1% to create the tech sector.   newlinechar Problem 1.2 The tech sector regained its momentum, however, in other countries. The bloated stock prices previously in the tech sector made it appear to be more of a *mirage* where as it really was an oversupply of inventories that the world market could not consume.  For the past 5 years, we have had the reverse problem: producing far less than our PPF, and far less than what we import.  Exports need to go up and it can't be on the backs of a middle class that is already 10% unemployed.

I'm American.  It's similar under US law.  You don't own the ground under your property in the US. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're in a city, there are municipal regulations that govern exactly how deep your ownership goes, but it's not very deep. newlinechar  newlinechar If you are in a rural area, you might own the property, but not own the mineral rights (chances are you do not).  Or the oil and drilling rights.  Friends who have bought property have gone back and spent a lot of money to acquire the mineral rights, because they were worried that the owners might, in the future, come in and start mining... which they have every right to do (and that's sort of fucked up).  Sometimes the corporation won't sell the  mineral rights. newlinechar  newlinechar Very few individuals in the US own much more than the topsoil and what is built upon it.  Mostly corporations do. newlinechar  newlinechar **However, in the US you *can* own the mineral rights (and other rights) whereas in *most* countries such as Canada these are reserved for the government only.** newlinechar  newlinechar In practical terms, however, the US isn't really any different because most individual people are not acquiring the mining or drilling rights to whatever land they purchase.

Well...nobody's going to agree with me, but I think it's just something they couldn't cover up--too many bodies. Besides, look at all the dumbshits now going into fed/overseas law enforcement. You can literally be a middle-aged, drugged-up, psychiatric mess on a bunch of meds living at a halfway house, start taking classes at NDU and a little more than a year later get a nice NSA job. *And CIA?* Same, only you have to be younger.

Infringement does not mean you can't be financially harmed. This is where people get tripped up. Infringement means they made an unauthorized copy. You may very well lose sales because of it. However, for it to be stealing they would need to take a copy from you or take money from you that you already have. newlinechar  newlinechar Every time they make a copy, you don't 'lose' anything, you just don't gain what you *possibly* could have gained had they not made a copy. For the economic loss to be stealing, you would literally have to have money disappear from your bank account. That's not what happens. What happens is that **new** money *doesn't* go into your bank account that otherwise might have.

I think it would be a good idea to personally review the information available about him online, if you haven't already. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with [**ironfroggy_**](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/akk2t/need_advice_on_a_sex_offender_in_my_lgbt_group/c0i1y2f), in that if this person said or alluded to something that was enough to make someone suspicious enough to check and see if he was a sex offender (and I'm assuming this was more along the lines of 'naw, sex is *good* for children, like castor oil!!' than 'omg that twelve-year old over there is so cute!') then he's probably at a fairly high risk to reoffend, either because he's in denial about the significance of his behavior or because he lack self-control.  It is difficult to believe that he is not currently on parole;  your local sex offender registry make have that information. newlinechar  newlinechar I would caution you against making assumptions about the meaning of 'molested', if the registry is not more specific than this.  The wording of such charges tends towards the inflammatory side.  If the crime for which he was imprisoned involved forcible rape, especially of a stranger, then you've got a very dangerous person there.  If the crime involved a mental health crisis...  well, okay, it doesn't sound like it.  Just that that's a somewhat different kettle of fish, with different circumstance and likelihoods of reoffending.  But in either case, there's *no way* he's supposed to be anywhere near underaged kids. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, if you might end up with a significant number of young members, and you don't have correspondingly widespread parental involvement, there's the question of whether or not you're essentially setting yourselves up to act in loco parentis, both as adults and as role models. newlinechar  newlinechar In such a case I feel that you very, very, very seriously need to discuss what the ground rules of the group should be with your current members.  On the one hand, some people are going to reject the strict rule of law, with some fairly strong history on their side.  They're going to feel, for instance, that if they're seventeen, that it's stupid that they can't date someone who's nineteen (or twenty-five).  On the other hand, short, cute, enthusiastic, shiny-eyed people tend to attract a fair bit of attention from a wide spectrum of people, and if there isn't a strong consensus on what the social rules are, then it becomes much more difficult for people to challenge or question the behavior of others.
No, if you actually *had the fucking balls* to apologize, it would be a sign that you had changed. But since you're still so focused on yourself to even understand the point of apologizing, it's obvious that nothing about you has changed at all. You're a pretty pathetic excuse for a human being.

The '.' is visually larger because of the lack of 'black' on top of the period.  But this should also be true in monospaced fonts, maybe even more so since the monospace period character takes up more space and therefore has more lack of 'black' on top.   newlinechar Yet, period + space (visually large) + space for mono fonts and period + space (not as visually large) for proportional?

Actually you can do exactly that. Steams DRM works because no one wants to bother cracking it. You own those games legitimately already so why would you bother installing a no-cd crack and risk getting your account banned? There are no cd-cracks and plenty of other mods out there however. You can install custom files and even new game exes directly into the games folders. They also have loader programs which will load games from your steam folder without steam (some non-valve games don't even require that and will run through the game exe itself even without turning on steam - though that's fairly rare).  newlinechar  newlinechar All that said I have over a thousand dollars worth of games at today's prices (though rest assured I did not pay even half that amount since most my games came from awesome sale packages) - so I'm not exactly going to go around fucking with anything that could get it my games banned. I do have friends who do however, most use different steam accounts for it to avoid getting their own banned. A few of my friends have been playing pirated Modern Warfare 2 *through* steam for the last month or so. There's even tools that allow you to connect online to play with other people. I'm pretty sure they've all caved in and bought it now though :)

I appreciate and understand the sentiment, but I think you misunderstand the 'fighting words' doctrine as laid out in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire. In Street v. New York, the Court ruled that fighting words needed to contain specific violent intent as opposed to mere offensiveness. In Cohen v. California, the Court ruled that fighting words had to be directed at a specific person. So the protest in question wouldn't fall under the category of 'fighting words.' newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the protest in question fails the imminent lawless action test laid out in Brandenburg v. Ohio. The action must first have the intent of inciting others to lawless action--direct advocacy must be present, not an abstract call to lawless action. The action must also have the strong likelihood of inciting others to imminent lawless action. The protest definitely fails the first prong of that test. newlinechar  newlinechar As distateful as it is, the protest is constitutionally-protected speech. The point I was making in my post was that the First Amendment doesn't protect 'even the ugliest forms of speech,' as the OP posited.
Let me tell you about how much disregard I have had for innertube sizes and how lucky I have been so far.

This is true, but when it comes down to actually convicting someone of anything, having nothing but the word of others is akin to witch trials in which someone squeals witch and points their fingers. I think the jury's incompetence had a lot to do with the conviction, but the biggest flaw is that this even went to trial. There was evidence that the defendant's character was questionable, but not any physical evidence that he had committed any crime.

Ok, but that's almost exactly my point. newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `const` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.1st}` newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `flip const` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.2nd}` newlinechar  newlinechar To understand the Haskell version, you have to think about what definition of the const function and what it would mean to exchange the arguments, because this isn't a natural thing to do with a function (IMHO). Whereas in Swym, first class functions always take one argument. So the Swym equivalent is just a function that takes a list, and returns the second element of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I know which _I_ find clearer, at least. newlinechar  newlinechar Or you want to keep the function call in there: newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `flip foo` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.2nd.foo(.1st)}` newlinechar  newlinechar Less terse this time, but IMO, still far less confusing.

You and I will depart from agreement here, but I disagree that people who stay with Nietzsche end up as Randians or selfish neo-conservatives. I also disagree that, as you said, 'his time has passed.' newlinechar  newlinechar I *do* think that Nietzsche creates a unique place for self-interest in philosophy and activity; however, to take that 'self' to be what some would call the ego is a dreadful misreading and this is where I think a lot of people go wrong with Nietzsche. The will to power underlies everything for Nietzsche, even the ego or the conscious self; taking the ego to be an in-itself (ie. to be at the very bottom of the ladder) is to take a symptom for a cause. newlinechar  newlinechar I can see someone who has interpreted Nietzsche's 'selfishness' to mean social/egotistical self-interest turning into a Randian or a selfish neo-conservative; but at this point the actor would have departed from Nietzsche in a fundamental and unequivocal way. newlinechar  newlinechar By selfishness, Nietzsche seems to mean not letting the social/ethical completely dominate the field of action/activity of a will; only through 'self-interest' (of the will, not the ego) is it possible to grapple with the tension between slave and master, reactive and active. To 'become who you are' is to let the will actively assert itself, not to egotistically react to social stimuli. When Nietzsche speaks of domination, this is what he means ('become who you are!') and not political or social domination. newlinechar  newlinechar On a side note, it's worth noticing who Nietzsche is writing for; or rather, easier would be to note who he *isn't* writing for. Nietzsche is not an egalitarian, but neither is he someone who subscribes to a structural (ie. cultural-linguistic order taken to be universal) hierarchy. He has no way of claiming once and for all *who* he is writing for, but it is clearly not for everyone. In *Beyond Good and Evil*, for example, he is writing to the 'philosophers of the future,' a maddeningly (but necessarily) empty category. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: May I assume that you read Nietzsche as an existentialist?

Under the category listing Prasoc's infractions leading to his comment being downvoted you checked off that it was being downvoted for 'improper grammar, punctuation, and/or capitalization.' Now while it may be technically correct(although this is the best kind of correct) that while his comment did contain improper grammar, punctuation, and/or capitalization, I don't believe this is why he was being downvoted because his infraction in that area was extremely minor and worth forgiving.

If you update a property in an imperative language you do something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar     x.prop = new value newlinechar  newlinechar What we are doing here is changing a memory location to a different value. What does this look like in a purely functional language? We cannot change the old object, we have to create a new 'changed' version: newlinechar  newlinechar      let newX= x {prop = new value} newlinechar  newlinechar (this is how it looks in Haskell) newlinechar  newlinechar What this does is it copies all properties of x into a new record *execpt* prop, for prop it uses new value. So what happens when you do something like this: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Allocate space for the newX newlinechar 2. Copy all properties except prop to newX newlinechar 3. Set prop of newX to new value newlinechar 4. (maybe later) garbage collect the old x
right! I haven't found anyone who writes sci-fi like Banks. It seems to satisfy my desire for invention, world-building, complex political and interpersonal relationships... and also makes me work to figure out certain things: dialog isn't always clear (who's talking now?) and motivations can be murky. He introduces concepts and lets you read a third of the book before he explains what they are or how they originated. But it works.

i'm not saying don't get involved if you see some sort of inequality or injustice occuring... just don't be surprised if the street fight you're trying to break up ends up breaking you up.  newlinechar  newlinechar one thing that will help you is if the bystander effect is in full effect - say something like 'somebody DO something, this is fucked up,' or 'OK,OK you've fucking won already. the guy's had enough.' - i.e., in the situation where a guy is knee-mounting someone and hitting them while they're helpless...  newlinechar  newlinechar most often the bystanders are as shit-scared and inexperienced with fighting as you are, but if the aggressor suddenly has 6-7 people telling him to back off, it may steal his thunder. safety in numbers, and you may need to shake people up before they join you.

well, that's actually an interesting point about not wanting to be romantically interested in a post-op trans - because you know that they're not the same as all the other woman, and you're interested in woman that you trust was not a man at some point. I certainly can't blame you, because its admittedly a weird thought lying next to someone who you know has changed something like that. Personally I see it as a quality of someone - that they were able to wrestle with the fact that they didn't feel right in their body, and were able to take steps to become comfortable instead of just being depressed or confused or outcast sort of thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar Something interesting I've learned in the past year is that it doesn't come down to gay or straight, or even that bullshit meter where everyone is a little gay, maybe 82% straight though - some people are only attracted to a culturally defined Man - some are attracted to anything that has a penis. Many can't fathom the idea of sleeping with a transgender, and some don't give a damn what the gender preference / physical genitalia are: as long as the person is a sweetheart they'll be attracted to them. newlinechar  newlinechar As for myself, I've always had qualities / tendencies that are deemed feminine even though I was raised as a good church boy in a town that demonized anything-but-straight, and trying to hide those qualities was very confusing and frustrating. Since moving to a city and gaining friends who couldn't care less if I was straight or not, I've been much more comfortable with who I am without worrying about whether people think I'm gay or even confuse me with a woman. I simply don't try to adhere to manhood. So that's my way of breaking a bit of a gender barrier.
Well, for something to be frowned upon, it has to exist, right?
No, not at all. This was a year ago. We were friends for 5 months, we had an amazing emotional bond like I've never experienced before.

Except that, judging from a cursory glance and the examples in this thread, swym is quite ambiguous, while in haskell (and just about any programming language) everything has a precise and well-defined meaning (which is good). You *have* to think about what the definition of the `const` (or any other) function is, because you want specify the behaviour of a program, and the computer cannot figure out, out of thin air, what you mean by '2nd' etc if you don't tell it *exactly* what you mean. So what you think is 'hideous' and 'unnatural' is in fact *necessary*. (Of course, in the case of `const` and other simple / standard functions, you don't really have to think, because the definitions are already internalized.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar btw, I don't find `{.2nd}` any clearer than `flip const` (actually it's the opposite). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Whereas in Swym, first class functions always take one argument: the Swym equivalent is just a function that returns its second argument. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, but I cannot make any sense out of this sentence (or its parts). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, `const` is just a function that returns its first argument. We gave it a name, because it is used often enough.

Denmark played along with the Nazis, but 'play' is the operative word. When the King was ordered to tell all the Jews to go to the train station, he worded his decree in such a way as to declare all Danes to be Jews...  newlinechar 'All of my subjects, who are Jewish, ...' (something like that -- note the comma)'.  newlinechar  newlinechar So just about everybody in Denmark showed up at the train stations. The Germans threw up their hands and said 'Let's try that again some other time'. In the meanwhile, the Jews were being smuggled into Sweden on anything that would float.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's really nothing they could have effectively done in a military sense. But they did take their token pound of flesh as it were, when the German column entered the palace grounds. The royal guards were there to meet them, with the king on a balcony. An officer directed the guards into a formal formation, marching around all ceremoniously, then gave the order to fire. The guards, in their ceremonial uniforms got ready, prepared to fire, lowered their antique rifles at the Germans, who were filming the whole thing, and quite enjoying their 'welcome to Denmark' presentation. Then came the order, 'fire!'. And they did. Needless to say it was all over in seconds. Then, and only then, did the king surrender.  newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, the parliment drew straws and 'elected' a new Prime Minister, knowing that whoever got the 'honor' was going to have to take a lot of humiliation. But unlike Norway's Quisling, he didn't have his heart in it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I imagine Germany got more than just one airfield out of the occupation, such as a strategic location on the straits to the Baltic. And indeed, there were quite a few who joined the German Army and a few who became Gung-ho Nazis, considering that they were pure Nordic people, and welcome to join the Race of Supermen.  newlinechar  newlinechar But the people mostly acted something like slaves or occupied people normally do, by helping as little as possible, and intentionally being incompetent whenever it was appropriate. For Germany, Denmark was more trouble than it was worth. For Denmark, it was a matter of minimizing the humiliation of the inevitable.  newlinechar  newlinechar Israel deemed Denmark to be a 'righteous gentile' nation for its success in saving its Jews. Just pointing out that there are exceptions to the claim of universal guilt in the war.

The idea of *support groups* is that they are there to support you, however you might need it. Some people never contribute, others are frequent contributors. Often, the membership of support groups fluctuates over time, as new people enter and others leave, and as the members' needs change (e.g., you might go regularly one year, and only once or twice the next year). Usually the support group meets at a regular time, and is open to whoever shows up. A good way to find a support group in your area is to check with [NAMI](http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=Find_Support).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [If you were in *group therapy*, it's possible that it would be a different story. Group therapy sounds similar to a support group, but it's actually quite different. Group therapy is a specific, structured type of therapy that is time limited (like maybe 12 weeks), each participant is expected to come each week (and membership is closed - you can't just 'show up'), and where the group sets its own rules for how they will proceed (including, perhaps, how much people need to contribute).]

The issue is logistical - you'd have to get them there, then get them back.  Ice flow movement isn't even a major problem - even a fast moving ice flow doesn't move that fast, and I think you generally only need a day or so worth of data pre-flight and a couple hours post flight.  Even if locating it on ice wouldn't work, with 50-100km to work with you're generally going to be able to find some rock outcropping to locate on, particularly near the margins, which tend to be pretty mountainous.  It's just that we'd end up needing a ton of them (there is a lot of ground to be covered) and what we get without them is good enough.  The amount of effort we'd have to put in to locate our own base stations would probably exceed the effort of the actual flights. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm familiar with the techniques for using multiple base stations - the software from Applanix that we use for post-processing calls it 'Smart Base' and is capable of handling a pretty large number of stations.

Assume a human being needs 1 pound of food per day, and that the average human weighs 150 pounds.   newlinechar  newlinechar That means 1/150th = 0.67% of the population would need to be killed every day to feed the rest. At that rate the human population would be halved every 108 years. So it 2099, the machines would have about half the original humans.  Rearing children would have a higher energy requirement, though. newlinechar  newlinechar So it's not actually that crazy, depending on how many humans the machines needed.  Definitely not sustainable, though, you'd think the machines would put some solar collectors in space or something.

Well, a trackball isn't going to be much an improvement over a joystick compared to a full functioning mouse.   newlinechar  newlinechar However, it seems the microsoft and sony want to differentiate their products from the computer market, so keyboard/mouse type addons hurt that image.

Oh believe me - if I didn't have a large chest (in proper sizing, I'm a 38G) I would be buying bras at department stores and shopping sales bins for cute, delicate cotton bras. But, when I used to buy bras at a chain store (La Senza here in Canada, which is owned by Victoria's Secret) I would wear a 40DD which I later found out did not fit correctly. It would move around all day and cut into me and I'd be adjusting all day and making sure I didn't 'spill out' of the cups. I had a lot of back problems, clothes didn't fit properly, etc. Once I got a 'proper fitting', unfortunately these larger sizes are only carried by European 'fancy' bra stores. These bras are usually handmade and usually have a lot of structural strength compared to some of the bras I would throw away after 6 months. One of the sales ladies told me that she has a bra that she bought at this particular store fifteen  years ago.  I'm going on three years with a particular one and it's still in perfect shape (minus a bit of stretching of the band, but that's to be expected). newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: I know it's a lot. I wish I didn't have to spend that much. But at a 38G, I can either dish out the money and a little more time for washing, or have my boobs look ridiculously awful, be really uncomfortable and have more back problems than I already have. But yeah, people don't think it's worth it really. But to me, it is :) newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: By 'ridiculously awful', I mean just that I would have the 'four boob' syndrome because of spillage and they would sag more because the band wasn't the correct size. Not trying to shame peoples bodies!

I have no desire to have an arranged marriage, but I'm sympathetic to the rationale.  So here's my case: newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  People who aren't married have no meaningful experience to guide them as to what makes a marriage work.   People who are married have a much greater sense of what does and does not matter in a life partner. newlinechar  newlinechar 2.  Marriage is about two families coming together not two individuals.  This would be harder for people from western cultures to understand, but in other cultures families are much more significant sources of support and structure in people's life.  A two person support system is a flimsy one and the larger family is ultimately more important.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think these reasons are enough to make arranged marriage make sense in a western economy, but they're both definitely true beliefs that can be held by sympathetic non-insane people.

This is why I learned early on that smoking often would be a bad idea for me. Just like with alcohol, I slept a fairly rock-solid and dreamless night, but it was not restful in the slightest. I value my sleep a lot and try never to get less than 7.5-8 hours of sleep, 9 if I can get away with it. Even with more sleep, after smoking, I would still not feel rested and have that kind of depressed hangover feeling by later the next day.

In C++ a const collection of data would have to be copied in its entirety when a function needed to produce a new collection based on the original, and copying is expensive. Functional languages support immutable collections that can share data that they have in common, so only the differences between the original and the new collection have to be maintained. C++'s const doesn't help with this at all. This is what I mean by lack of support for immutability, not simple const-ness. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The lack of garbage collection would be another huge impediment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you learn to use a functional language and then go back and try to write similar code in C++ you'll see very quickly and clearly what you're up against. newlinechar  newlinechar

While it doesn't make me depressed in any way, I do know that marijuana hangover feeling. newlinechar  newlinechar Initially I smoked very rarely because it took at least a day to get back to my normal non-groggy self. But as I gradually smoked more until it became a regular habit that feeling went away. newlinechar  newlinechar I actually get a much better sleep with marijuana; I sleep like a rock every night, because without it my dreams usually wake me up in succession. newlinechar  newlinechar Regular mj smokers adjust to where it becomes normal and sleeping is no problem. I can take a hit right before sleeping just to clear my mind and pass out. However, once you stop or take a break, the REM sleep bounces back hard as your brain chemistry adjusts back to normal without the added THC.

I'm thinking he was under the impression you were talking about the first Tennenbaum encounter, which is about 15 minutes into the game.  The second one is in the final chapter and there's really only 30~45 minutes of gameplay left (Although I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the apartment buildings). newlinechar  newlinechar As for the weapons, I'm just going to say I disagree.  Finding all the upgrade stations was pretty much vital for me.  It could be because I played the game on Hard mode, but the game wasn't as easy as you'd made it out to be.  Upgrading my pistol to more damage, and my machinegun to less recoil made me incredibly  more powerful.  Onto your comment about plasmids,  after freezing an enemy, one hit will unfreeze them, and on hard mode you never kill an enemy in one hit, regardless of their state.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for your previous comments on anticipating enemy movements, that contradicts your whole argument.  First you complain about how you can't predict their movements and counter them easily, but then you turn around and say the game was too easy.  While I'm on the subject, I felt that the enemies behaved exactly how you'd expect them too.  They're people whose minds have been corrupted by plasmids and are desperate for Adam.  They behave like animals.  The animations work well in describing that, and you can clearly tell the different splicers apart by how they behave.  10/10 from me, but maybe that's just me paying too much attention (Or maybe just more than the average player) to the game. newlinechar  newlinechar So I guess in summation, I'm saying that you must've played the game on the easiest difficulty, or just tried to master chief through the game and didn't really get into it.

I'm of the general opinion that some people are unable to help themselves. She obviously was unhappy given your description of the situation and rationalized going back. For some reason you made it easy for her. newlinechar  newlinechar Generally speaking weak people seek strength. If you want to help them you need to present yourself as someone they can lean against. You don't offer or suggest help, you push it on them. If you two had a connection she shouldn't have abandoned you so easily. She should have felt guilty for leaving you. You don't tell someone like that it's her life and your okay and will understand with her going back. I know it sounds bad but this is the only way you can help such a person; by being similar in demeanor as her abuser. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe I'm delusional and don't know what I'm talking about. I just have the impression that you have to be a controlling, demanding man when you want to help someone like that. I see prostitutes as 'weak' and I feel that is why they rely and so easily get 'taken' by pimps. I think you have to play that role in such a situation. I don't know if this makes any sense. I personally never dealt with such a situation but I was raised with abuse and know all to well about rationalizing it and feeling sorry for your abusers. Sometimes you need someone who can do and say what you can't to take you away from bad situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know if that made any sense...  newlinechar  newlinechar As for finding her, do you know her full name? Maybe hire an investigator. You must have some information on her if she lived with you.  newlinechar  newlinechar After reading your post I just feel bad that there is a girl out there living in such bullshit and you seem the only one who can help her.  newlinechar

Well said.  I agree.  But remember, my original argument was meant as advocacy.  I think those of us, whatever our personal views, who want politics to be more than a circus, should only use labels which evoke legitimate intellectual traditions when we talk about serious, thoughtful people.  If we refer to gadflies and provocatuers and self-promoters by the same terms, we are essentially saying that there is no difference in legitimacy between the serious people and the people who are out for personal gain -- or just trying to tear it all down.

I didn't say we should use pictorial languages for computer programming.  I said graphical and interactive two dimensional notations and we shouldn't be limited to text. newlinechar  newlinechar Just take the specific example I gave.  Would it not be useful to be able to use that type of mathematical notation inside of computer programs that contained mathematical formulas? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Shifting to textual languages from pictorial ones was an inflection point in the growth of human knowledge newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I wasn't talking about pictorial languages, but anyway, have we really shifted entirely to textual languages in the way that computer programming languages are textual?  Does an architect use textual languages?  Do  mechanical/electrical/civil engineers use textual languages to design and develop their systems?  Do business analysts use textual languages to develop and document their processes?  Do mathematicians use textual languages to do their work? Does a software engineer design and document a large software system or framework with many different classes involving teams of developers in Notepad?  Are those professionals solving complex problems? newlinechar  newlinechar When we stopped drawing general pictures and moved towards more abstract glyphs etc. that had established meanings, that was an improvement, but the reason that our language is a series of glyphs/letters/words is because it is meant to be spoken, and we can only make one sound at a time, so we make a series of them in order to represent more information.  That is the reason we ended up with alphabets/words/paragraphs etc., not because linear streams of symbols are ideal.  Its because we are talking monkeys. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; shifting from 1Dish to 2Dish languages isn't going to make a big deal of difference to problems that are often very multidimensional newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, problems are often very multidimensional.  Relying on textual languages that are more or less single dimensional and have to be decompressed and expanded into structures by our minds makes it harder to solve  and understand problems. newlinechar  newlinechar Analysts that do multidimensional analysis on product data for example using OLAP tools that have two or sometimes three dimensional views would disagree with you if you suggested that they should be limited to textual reports (in paragraph form, really is what you are suggesting, since programming languages don't even have built-in facilities for tables). newlinechar  newlinechar

I have a personal policy to use whatever pronoun the person in question prefers.

Why does the profit motive somehow leave people looking for help in health care, yet in every other aspect of life has the ability to make goods and services available to citizens? The real fact is that government intervention in the market (limited competition among doctors, pharmaceuticals, and health insurance; tax incentives to buy health insurance rather than health care; subsidization of care) has made health care not work in the US. We have a quasi-government controlled industry whose problems are masqueraded around as being caused by the free market and profits, when the problems are caused not by profit, but by the intervention we are told we so desperately need. newlinechar  newlinechar Medicare has proven itself to be an inefficient system.

Capitalism itself is evidence of a dumbed-down population. Nearly all advertisements contain small lies; the idea that a certain beer is more 'fresh' for example, or that a burger is 'jucier'.

Thanks; I should have included putting Jesus 'back' into the government as part of the devil's deal. Atheism, perhaps because so many atheists are embittered; allowed itself to be redefined by the neocons as the enemy of religion (Christianity in particular) they needed to mobilize the religious right, when its proper role is an alternative to religion which doesn't serve the neocon agenda of division and hate at all. There seemed to be such a surge of militant atheist voices during the Cheney/Bush years which more-or-less went away with them; I often wonder how many were merely part of a greater neocon disinformation campaign.

Well, with the Y2K, simple patches were able to fix any possible problems. The only 'major' issues would arise in banking and applications that rely on the year.

There is no 'patch' or something to solve it. There is a hard limit in how many addresses are available. Once that limit is hit, they can't just add more addresses.

I think forums like this are the best way to convey certain things to people without offending them personally. newlinechar  newlinechar My tip to Indians is to put their clothes in a closet and close the door when they cook. Get a good exhaust fan that vents out -- you are dead if you are in an apartment -- like I suffered. Your choice is to keep some clothes in your car and use them. This way, the clothes don't pick up the spice smell. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: More explanation, from below: newlinechar I wasn't clear in my earlier response. The odor issue has a lot to do with oily, spicy cooking than other things. Indian cooking is designed for Indian homes which are well ventilated and where the kitchen is separated from living quarters. Here, in the USA, recirculated air is the norm. This is a huge problem if you cook with oil and spices. The spice flavored oil evaporates and settles on everything including clothes, hair etc. Indians who live in apartments are especially vulnerable to this problem. Keep clothes in closets or in some other place where the recirculated air doesn't reach.

There's no reason why health care should be thought of as any different than any other market when it comes to prices, profits, or abilities for individuals to pay for goods and services. newlinechar  newlinechar But, more specifically, the price mechanism in health care is broken. Too many regulations have made health care far more scarce than it would need to be. Subsidized health insurance (through both government options like Medicare and tax incentives to buy health insurance) makes people less interested in what individual treatments cost. These processes have made health care in America so expensive. The free market doesn't exclude anyone from consideration of resources because prices are supposed to rise and fall.

Introversion is a product of shyness. Or rather, being shy leads to a lot of inward thinking. You keep saying it's not conductive, but you give no reason why. Alcohol should never be the basis for a relationship, I agree, but that doesn't mean alcohol can't be involved, or shouldn't. Drinking is mainly a useful tool for interacting with people you don't know very well. It helps spur conversation, and it makes mundane situations more interesting. It is not necessary, but neither is watching movies, playing sports, videogames, etc.

A parachute captures air, thus slowing descent.  Since it captures air, there is a partial vacuum above the chute.  If someone drifts (or steers) under you, they effectively steal your air, as their parachute's vacuum will cause your parachute to collapse, thus plummeting you down until there is enough 'good' air to reinflate your chute.

Well, I do admit, it is an aquirred taste. When I got into metal, I initially only liked stuff with clean vocals, like classic Heavy Metal, Power Metal and Thrash. As I delved deeper into the underground, I encounter black metal, death metal, and grindcore. I thought to myself, what is this crap? How can one enjoy music with vocals like these. However, as I listened more, something changed, albeit very gradually. At first, I was just able to 'bear' it and be able to listen to the instrumentals, then I actually started to enjoy some of the more raspy, higher pitched vocals, and then finally, I was enjoying the most brutal of death metal. I guess it is much like alcohol in a sense. You don't start of with whiskey, you start of with beer. Even then, some people won't like it no matter how much they listen to it. To answer your question about what I like about it, I guess the simplest answer is that it fits the rest of the music. I mean, you wouldn't Cher fronting Mayhem, it just wouldn't sound right. newlinechar  newlinechar I have to say, I am very glad you asked about this. That shows you have much more an open mind than the average music consumer, and I respect that immensely. I hope that answers some of your questions. Not everybody likes the same music and that is fine. To one his own. :)
&gt; Now this would be an essentially imperative implementation [of FRP], and some purists may be not satisfied with that :) newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think purists (like myself and Luke) have any objection to imperative implementations.

Given (a), (b) is *even* more pragmatically important than usual. newlinechar  newlinechar One strength of Fran &amp; Reactive and (I think) Yampa is that they do have a precise *definition* of semantics, and so implementation correctness is a precise notion. newlinechar  newlinechar (*Edit:* added quotation at start.)

The president and the DOJ cannot, however, do anything concerning what judges rule. newlinechar  newlinechar If I were the AG (or if I were the president and directing the AG) I would probably fire the prosecutors who fucked this up in the first place, keeping these murderers from being held accountable.

I can't deny that's a contributing factor, but we've had wedge issues for decades (longer, really, but since the 60s they've been central to elections at the national level).  I have relatives and friends who are more likely to vote AGAINST a candidate because they disagree on a wedge issue irrespective of the rest of their platform.  So they person they agree with on most topics is the one they wind up voting against. And we've developed a system that is **highly** adept at finding those issues and developing candidates to capitalize on the issues.  There just doesn't seem to be much alternative to playing that game at this point, unfortunately.  Campaign in accusations, govern in prose.

&gt; The whole abusive partner and sociopath thing totally goes for love marriages as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but in love marriages you are depending on your own judgement rather than the judgement of someone else. Whether that's a good thing or not is entirely situational. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm going to try to be truthful as I can, and can only hope that person I'm meeting will be truthful as well. newlinechar  newlinechar That's all any of us can hope for. The point I was trying to make is that because love marriage is directly competitive, people are under pressure to create public personas which will enhance their desirability but which do not necessarily reflect their inner selves. I'm not referring exclusively to hobbies or preferences but also to emotional reactions and mental attitudes. Something like half of all love marriages end in divorce in the US, mostly due to 'irreconcilable differences'. Where were those irreconcilable differences when the couple was married? Either they have grown as people or they have removed their masks of public acceptability and found the other person underneath to be undesirable. Any concealment in arranged marriage is more likely to come in the form of an omission or a lie on the part of the families rather than the individual; there is no pressure to assume an emotional mask which conceals one's true disposition. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're taking a risk whether it's an arranged marriage or not newlinechar  newlinechar This is a great observation, one that I wish more people would make when they were seeking companionship.

Different games have used different solutions. newlinechar  newlinechar In older games (E.g. I know Unreal did it this way), the server receives everyone's commands and mouse position, and tells everyone where they are and where their bullets went. Pro: Simple, reliable. Con: Players have to compensate for lag when shooting... unless their machine is the server. newlinechar  newlinechar More modern games (E.g. I know Perfect Dark Zero did it this way): Each player's machine does its own physics and hit testing, and notifies everyone else where you are and who you've shot. Pro: Players can just aim normally, and not worry about adjusting for lag. Con: Aimbots. newlinechar  newlinechar I imagine there are plenty of hybrid solutions too. newlinechar  newlinechar And RTS games are a special case: the games are usually kept in perfect sync. Instead of sending hundreds of unit position updates every frame, you're just transmitting your _orders_. Pro: Perfect sync, and efficient use of bandwidth. Con: There's a (small, and predictable) delay before your units start responding to your orders, to ensure every player has time to receive them.

The thing that always makes me think about that are the few recognizable cars in my area. There's a boat builder (or washer?) who has his truck done up like a boat with wood sides and portholes on the cap. There's a bus with the number 108, which was an important number in the show Lost, so it stood out to me, and I've seen that bus all over the city since first noticing that. There's a fancy Lincoln-esque car that has a diplomat license plate and what almost appear to be ornate door knockers on each door (I think they're delegatory seals of some sort). Whenever I see these I wonder how often I'm among 'friends' on my local and even highway roads. All cars look so similar to me, though. I'm not into them, so I can't tell most apart. About the best I can do is say 'that one is a sporty coupe,' and 'that one is a 4-door sedan, in teal.' I loved that dragon car posted hear the other day. If every car had some personality like that, I bet I'd see the same people on a daily basis. newlinechar  newlinechar It reminds me... years ago I was working at an office near the Getty Center in Beverly Hills. There was a side road near that area that pops through the 405 out to what IIRC is Sepulveda. I saw a little car with a cute girl in it waiting for the light and we locked eyes and smiled at each other as I passed her. It happened 3 more days in a row. By the last day we both exchanged 'wtf?' looks, while also smiling and laughing. I began to think we would run into each other all the time, and eventually our paths would cross more intimately. Then on Friday she wasn't there. I never saw her again.

In essence, `foldr` has type `(a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b` and `reduce` has type `(a -&gt; a -&gt; a) -&gt; [a] -&gt; a`, right?  That is, one might define (inefficiently) newlinechar  newlinechar     reduce f as = foldr f (last as) (init as) newlinechar  newlinechar on non-empty lists.  Is there any sensible definition for `reduce f []` in general (i.e., when `f` does not have an identity)?

He's not saying there was an actual outbreak of crime or prison unrest.

Thank you for providing us with that video. I support that man, and feel deep sympathy for him, because he had the courage to speak out about the atrocities he is responsible for. You can clearly see that he regrets the decisions he made, but he is human enough to take responsibility for them. That is commendable. I wish there were many more like him who would be brave enough to speak out and take responsibility for the harm they have inflicted, instead of just drinking themselves to death, or even worse -boasting about it- after they are discharged.

Why do you think regular relationships are dishonest?
Change the people's attitude and way of thinking about certain things. Most of my friends back home are very close minded, almost racist, and aren't very accepting of others. The sad truth is, most Malaysians are that way. A Malaysian film maker who recently passed, Yasmin Ahmad, is one of my heroes. She made films that dealt with issues most people aren't willing to discuss, which even resulted in a film of hers getting banned in Malaysia. She made commercials that addressed racism, and also another addressing the Malay's attitude about dogs. I would very much like to continue the work she was doing. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Here's one of her commercials: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2XLZsiCBsA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=4085955DE6FCED02&amp;index=10
Bullshit. Religion is the vast majority of what divides them and especially what keeps the divisions entrenched.
The way he talks is engaging and he's very charismatic but he rambles quite a bit in his explanation (probably because he's so enthusiastic), making it hard to understand. As for the explanation itself, I thought he was going to explain the physics behind it (optics and light as he's written extensively about the latter), instead, he talks what many can already figure if he/she thinks about it. 
I do prefer solitary activities, and I never said shyness was required. I am simply both. And one trait stimulated the other. I am one definition of introvert, not all. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is not conductive to intellectual relationships because its effects are not conductive to intellectual conversation.  newlinechar  newlinechar This doesn't explain your position. You have given me a re-written thesis of your original statement. You need to define what constitutes an intellectual relationship, and why this cannot be achieved through or despite alcoholic consumption. You don't suddenly become an idiot just because you consume alcohol. If maintaining an intellectual composure is important to you, it will be the last thing you give up when inebriated. I have to ask, have you tried drinking before? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If we can't fairly quickly find an area of common interest for conversation then I'm not very interested in creating a relationship with that person. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, then you really miss out on forming a relationship with a lot of potentially great people. Most aren't willing to share all of their interesting traits in one conversation with a stranger. I'm pretty quiet and uninteresting around large groups.  newlinechar  newlinechar Individuals seem to have two modes of interaction: their professional personality, and their true personality. The first one is designed to protect themselves from getting hurt, or offending other people, so a lot of content is filtered. And the focus of conversation is less on themselves and more about whatever situation you are involved in with that person. The second one is filled with intimate and potentially embarrassing thoughts, but it may yield profoundly intelligent insights. Once you make it clear that you will never intentionally hurt that person, they will actually open up.  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe I'm unique, but I've gotten over some barriers through alcohol, in a couple of instances. Not all of my relationships have blossomed like this of course, but it helped me share things I wouldn't have otherwise in those situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think you are looking at it the wrong way: Alcohol is a means to an end. Relationships mature over time. This could lead to intellectual conversations, or it might not. Some people make good first impressions, other don't. The point is, you can't always expect someone to share their vast of knowledge immediately. People aren't open books.
I'm not sure about seeker, but I prefer 'reactionary' as a substitute to your use of the word 'radical.'  I want to leave open the possibility that some radical ideas are useful/good.

Ah, in my town it's pretty much all real posting.  Have you posted your own ad or just replied to ads?

Fair enough. I'm Indian, and I've heard the first two, but I've never really heard the third until I started reading reddit. Within my cultural sub-group, the custom of tipping is present at levels that are considered average to moderately-high, so for the most part, amongst my own people, I haven't noticed low tipping. To be fair though, I understand where the attitude against tipping within the freshly immigrated Indian diaspora comes from; they see restaurant waitstaff, from experience, as being paid an adequate wage and thus tipping seems ridiculous. In general though, you can't expect complete assimilation within the first generation of an immigrant group. Such behaviour is more expected in the second and third generations.
oh no I was not disputing that at all!  I meant rough for the cab drivers, the poor saps.
Not only are sex offenders human, but they are people who made very serious mistakes and at the same time, need to be re-integrated (or possibly for the first time) properly integrated into society.  Also, sometimes you concentrate on the known offenders and the unidentified ones make their move.  I'd suggest splitting the group up, into age appropriate groups.  I don't think youth, middle aged, and older should be (necessarily) co-mingling all the time.
That seems very different from what I'm wondering about.  If you get happiness from anticipating something, it's easy to understand why you'd plan such a thing even if it's not about to happen right now: you're increasing both your future happiness *and* your happiness right now.  That's pretty simple to understand. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm talking about decisions you make that *decrease* your current happiness (or, equivalently, deny you an increase you know you could have if you didn't make that decision) in favor of increasing your potential future happiness. newlinechar  newlinechar You'd like to eat that cake but you think you'll feel better later on if you don't; you'd like to spend money on something fun now but you think you'll be happier later if you save it, even though you don't have specific plans for what to spend it on later; you'd have a great time hooking up with him/her tonight, but you expect it'll cause you heartache later on; etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes people even go so far as to set up mechanisms to prevent themselves from doing what they know they'll choose to do later, because they don't trust the decisions they'll make then - so they put the cookie jar in a deep dark corner to shift the tradeoff they'll make later on when they're tempted to eat a cookie but not tempted strongly enough to go find the cookie jar, or they'll delete someone's number from their phone to guard against the time they may decide to call.
You 'have to do what you have to do' 'in order to keep it alive', but you claim to have a good community. Your great community can't even keep one server alive without having to fake user counts? newlinechar  newlinechar Point is: the practice of faking user counts annoys many people. I won't stop complaining, because I don't like it and wish it to stop, and frankly, I think it's a stupid thing to do. 
&gt;That the things we're going through, good or bad, are the worst or best that's ever happened. newlinechar  newlinechar Allow me to recap the situation for you in order to illuminate why some of us think things are particularly bad.. newlinechar  newlinechar First we had outright election fraud ignored by a court packed with Right wing shills. Fox News declared Bush the winner, and the others followed in a rush like lemmings. newlinechar  newlinechar We had a preventable attack on American soil shortly after our President received a briefing entitled 'Osama bin Laden determined to strike in US'. newlinechar  newlinechar Our President at the time used the unity and good will resulting from that attack to disassemble the Constitution piece by piece, reportedly referring to it as 'just a god damned piece of paper'. Habeas Corpus was then suspended indefinitely. newlinechar  newlinechar Our President or Vice President outed a CIA agent for political revenge, putting in danger any person with whom said agent ever had contact with in another country, as well as endangering the agent and her family. newlinechar  newlinechar Our Vice President engaged in closed door meetings with the energy industry in order to determine how to regulate the energy industry. newlinechar  newlinechar We cut the size of our army in order to 'cut the costs' of war. We then hired more expensive (and less trained) mercenaries to fulfill those roles. Often with dire consequence. newlinechar  newlinechar We attacked a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while simultaneously creating closer ties with the country where 18 of the 19 hijackers came from. Saudi Arabia. newlinechar  newlinechar We offered no-bid contracts for war supplies and services to a corporation with direct ties to the then-current Vice President. newlinechar  newlinechar Our President fired several US Attorneys to punish them for prosecuting his corrupt fellow political party members. newlinechar  newlinechar Our President deemed a decades old law called FISA to be unnecessary in the process of wiretapping American citizens communications, claiming it was retroactively within his power to do so in order to protect the United States. newlinechar  newlinechar Our President opened a prison outside the borders of the United States in order to bypass Constitutional law and hold prisoners indefinitely without charge, and also to torture them without repercussion. newlinechar  newlinechar When pressed about prisoner abuse and possible outright torture, our Attorney General referred to the Geneva Convention as 'quaint'. newlinechar  newlinechar Weary from so much of our founding law being completely ignored, America resoundingly elected a man who claimed he'd end the Bush era policies of warrantless wiretaps, chargeless indefinite detention, and 'legalized' torture. He claimed he'd bring us back to 'the rule of law'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, instead of disallowing the Bush era policies of warrantless wiretaps and indefinite detention, our new President seems determined to keep those policies as his own. But he did declare torture to be illegal once more. So, 1 out 3. newlinechar  newlinechar Our current President also campaigned on the promise of healthcare reform. Alluding very carefully to the idea of nationalized healthcare. Now, in the name of bipartisanship with the completely failed outgoing political party, our congress seems to be determined to pass a law that will somewhat benefit the citizenry while hugely benefiting the private insurance companies that are the entire problem. Lobbying dollars are openly and legally buying our government's votes. newlinechar  newlinechar The Republicans might be able to mount some kind of opposition to the bill if their goodwill wasn't all used up. Or, if they didn't fillibuster everything that the Democrats propose. Or, if their own idea of healthcare reform were not an even bigger give away to the insurance companies. newlinechar  newlinechar I hate to say this, but we may very well be watching the downfall of one of the greatest countries in history. I sincerely hope that I'm wrong.
No, that doesn't sound like the Hazelnut Brown at all.   newlinechar  newlinechar Most breweries at times use beer festivals/tasting events as a test-market so they are not always indicative of what the final product might taste like. newlinechar  newlinechar I am making some chili right now, and I wish I had a bottle of that Chipotle Ale right now to add to the chili (and drink alongside it).  I guess a bottle of Alaskan Amber will have to do.
Not only that, but I definitely get how girls feel having to live up to an unrealistic ideal.  One of the girls there was like 'Oh Scott you're like Edward - pale, skinny and gay!' newlinechar  newlinechar Editors note: I am not gay. I was dating one of the girls in the room.

*4) Low cost shares ('Penny Shares') are cheap and risky, any movement will cost you a fortune. High cost shares are, generally, safer however will take more movement to recoup costs, make profit. newlinechar Low cost shares are a lot riskier but can bring large gains. High cost shares are more stable but less 'exciting'.* newlinechar  newlinechar Which is a bigger company on the markets - MSFT or GOOG? MSFT trades at $30, GOOG trades at $620. newlinechar  newlinechar The answer is Microsoft, and you wouldn't know it by just knowing the stock price. Microsoft's market valuation is 270B, while Google's is 200B. Microsoft could be just the same company and have the stock price at $1, because they simply have more shares outstanding. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's my point - don't let the stock price drive your way of looking at a business, what you should rather be focusing on is the 'market cap.' This is the valuation the markets are placing on your entire business, or the cost at market value for the entire thing.

I do understand where you're coming from, because it's ridiculously annoying to hear people misuse academic terms all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I think it matters in terms of context and communication. The purpose of words, and language in general, is to efficiently communicate concepts.  The fact is, if 90% people use a word a certain way, the most efficient way to communicate with them will to use to the colloquial definition rather than the 'dictionary' definition.  It would just be a waste of time to use it 'correctly' and provide a subtext or extra explanation every time I use the word when I'm in conversation with people. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, context matters too.  If I'm writing an academic paper I'm going to use the correct terms, and perhaps clarify to the reader of which definition I am referring to.  Even if I'm having an 'intellectual' discussion, I might still do the same thing.  The problem is that words such as 'conservatism' are socially defined. Regardless of whatever's in the dictionary, or urban dictionary, the people that are being referred to when you say the word 'conservatives' are the people that call themselves 'conservatives.'  In the context of most political discussions, this is what matters, because this is the concept that is being communicated in this situation. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is, even the official dictionary people have come to terms with this. The OED will add colloquialisms if they have become prevalent in society.  I'm sure half of the words that I use in conversation started out as colloquialisms and were eventually just added to the dictionary.  I might hate it, and you might hate it, but the fact is, if I'm trying to communicate with someone, theres an easy way and theres a difficult way...

It's highly likely that your changes have decreased prices across the board for customers in a way that more than makes up for a couple dozen lost incomes. newlinechar  newlinechar Back when Obama pushed his tariff against chinese tire manufacturers, an economist ran the numbers and determined that the money saved by every american on tires would dwarf the economic effect of lost american jobs, to the point that we could tax everyone to maintain the lost employees at $100,000/yr to do nothing and still come out ahead collectively. It's idiotic to protect a few, whose trade has been obsoleted, by keeping thousands of other people from savings.

Well, I guess then I could edit it to say: since we cook with milk all the time, and since I know what milk tastes like; it tastes good. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, semen, IMHO, tastes disgusting. Ingesting it during a blowjob is a sexual favor to do for someone, and if it's done in a sexual act then it has the potential to be very arousing. I might fantasize about being forced to swallow someone's semen, and a part of the sexy thing about it is the concept that it doesn't taste good. Good to have a small amount during sex; bad to cook with. newlinechar  newlinechar And personally, I can't stand flan made with whatever its normally made with, so seeing a picture of it made with semen is disgusting.

However, again, these are all good argument for not despising the troops. What I'd like to hear, however, is a good argument for actually respecting the troops. At best, these are people who signed up for the military without taking care to find out the current state of affairs, based on blind beliefs into the institution, and who are now blindly executing their superiors' orders. Sometimes, these orders cause them to shoot and kill civilians, whose only fault is for being citizens of a country the U.S. decided to invade. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'it's not their fault' argument doesn't help me to understand why I need to respect the soldiers.

Also, if your hair is too frizzy, wash it way less (try once a month); curly hair can get pretty dry when it's longer.

Thank you for engaging me in civilized debate. newlinechar  newlinechar This is actually a fairly deep issue. newlinechar  newlinechar I do understand that there will always be those who, when faced with the pleas of their neighbours will turn a cold shoulder in favor of their own comfort and happiness. newlinechar  newlinechar I do not believe that this will be the majority of people. I will agree with you about the need for organisation to address the needs of the homeless, crippled, mentally ill or just generally poor and unskilled or uneducated. My beef is with the idea that this can only be done properly through governments with taxation as the means of income. newlinechar  newlinechar A few quick points: newlinechar  newlinechar -Private charities address the needs of many. Even today they are necessary to fill the gaps that government programs do not cover. They were around in the U.S. before government programs were implemented newlinechar  newlinechar -One of the main needs for organization in charities is to present the public with the needs of these people and ask for help in their name and administer the allocation of time resources and benefits to those in need. So, the idea,presented earlier, of going 'door to door' is not accurate. newlinechar  newlinechar -When I give out of choice, I have done a good deed. When money is taken forcefully from me I have no choice and the moral good of the act is removed. I cannot chose not to pay taxes. newlinechar  newlinechar -The idea espoused by many that 'everyone deserves at least the following...and we must tax everyone so that it can be provided' seems to stop at our political borders. Why not tax us all to pay for these things for Africans. Are they not our fellow humans as well and are they no less deserving merely by this fact alone? And once you draw a line, it seems somewhat arbitrary from a humanitarian point of view. newlinechar  newlinechar For those who are humanitarian in nature (all of us to varying degrees), we will use the money not taken in taxes (extra disposable income) to give to the needy as we chose. In this way, we can also evaluate the effective performance of these charities in terms of efficiency (something which is already monitored as I found out when given the option to have my paycheck garnered and re-directed to some of a number of charities).

It doesn't matter if some worthless spreadsheet software was not checked for Y2K compliancy. The real victims of Y2K were the critical software for institutions that originally ran on mainframes and minicomputers, made from the 60s and 70s that had no space for two additional bytes. Most of those systems ran on COBOL, System/360 assembly or machine code, with binary files and nothing remotely similar to RDBMSs. newlinechar  newlinechar How many countries had significant software infrastructure dating from that time?

Nope, the article can't even bother itself to mention that, or even how it got the numbers for its research. newlinechar  newlinechar What I do know is that massive finantial institutions, insurance corporations, banks, and government agencies had to have code auditing at every level to guarantee that things would work, and changing things at that level is not easy. When altering the binary format of a mainframe dataset that's been in use for 40 years in a payroll system sometimes the only option is to append information at the end of colums.

Get on a computer with a decent mouse, now pick several points on the screen and seen how fast and accurate you can move your mouse to each location in succession. Now imagine doing the same with a controller.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's a reason a lot of console fpses have buttons to do a 180 turn around, the thumbstick is not sensitive enough to allow for high speed. The mouse on the other hand is designed to respond to how quickly a mouse is moved so that it amplifies the distance traveled (if you move a mouse really quickly 5 cm, it will travel a greater distance than if you moved it slowly 5 cm). This means PC users can snap to their targets  instantly and then make very accurate adjustments. If there was someone dextrous enough to tell their thumbs to tilt at very precise angles, this would also be possible on the console (if the thumb stick has that many degrees of sensitivity.

Plus, I have to admit to being against pasturization, I don't even drink pasturized cider ( though would use it for hard cider, but I can easily taste the differnce when fresh). I don't know what I am going to do when I move, I am addicted to fresh cider, I drink at least a gallon a week.

Anyway, it was you who asked newlinechar &gt; why did depleted uranium not cause an increase in the years 1991 to 1996? newlinechar  newlinechar not me. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your article is from 4 years ago, what evidence have they found since then? newlinechar  newlinechar In the article it says newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'Naturally, the nations leading the war refuse to acknowldege that this type of uranium can be harmful. But as an epidemiologist, I have to say that every bit of radiation can give rise to cancer. It's just a question if what was fired in this case led to an increase in the number of cancer cases,' said Professor Eberhard Greiser from the University of Bremen. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Every bit' is evidence enough for me. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Yes I did, my figures are rough estimates but they are still better estimates than pretending every child in the Falluja region is born in the main hospital. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't see where somebody is pretending this. And again, I can't give you any more numbers. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Until you have some numbers worth discussing no one will listen. newlinechar  newlinechar And that's how our discussion ends. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your point was to try and show the use of depleted uranium weapons is causing neural tube defects and cancer in Iraq and Gaza. newlinechar  newlinechar It wasn't, how could I ? You'll find my first post here, I'm sure.  newlinechar On the other hand ..  newlinechar &gt; It's just a question if what was fired in this case led to an increase in the number of cancer cases newlinechar  newlinechar you can try to show me what else the cause could have been. newlinechar Don't worry, I don't need numbers, plain logic would be sufficient.
You say Airbus owns short haul, but that's because they took it from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas (who are now merged into just Boeing now). Doesn't your attribution of the ownership of the shorthaul market to a company that was just entering it 20 years ago make a strong case for entering markets that already have strong companies in them? newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, Airbus has done very well with the A330, carving out a pretty good chunk of the long haul market. And given that Boeing is reiterating their 20% fuel savings figures for the 787 after recent testing, it's likely the 787 is going to all but kill the A330 (which is why Airbus finally got serious about the A350XWB). newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, after Airbus created the twin-engine long haul plane market with the A300/A310, Boeing came in and dominated the large plane long haul market with the 777. It did this so well that the last 747-400 was built a few weeks ago and it may possibly be the last passenger 747 ever built. newlinechar  newlinechar To me all these cases show that you can enter the airplane market owned by your competitor and do well.

I'm not sure what you're getting at, but if you read your own post a few lines above, you will see that you were claiming that newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Liberals campaigned on the promise that they wouldn't form a coalition with the NDP. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, this is incorrect. And as the Bloc agreed to vote with the coalition on any matters of confidence for 18 months, it was clear that the coalition had a majority of votes to form a government. That later on, after Harper had shut down Parliament, Ignatieff became leader and scuppered the coalition is another matter altogether.

They didn't topple the government when they returned because they had a new leader, who had opposed the coalition from the beginning.

Fair enough.  I actually went through a series of books in my head, but thought of something better.

Nevertheless, I think the OP is saying that there is entomological disparity between the word and its modern connotation.

That's a really tough question. I was in a kind of pseudo relationship (which just ended a couple days ago) with a girl who is on at me all the time about 'opening up'.

In what world does that give your conspiracy theory validity?  The difference is Copernicus and Galileo's work were based on research, logic, and science.

To briefly expand on his point, the precision of a mouse is vastly greater than the precision of a pair of thumbsticks. That makes it a lot more fun to play on the PC; you quite literally can't have a competitive FPS on the console without an autoaim sytem. On the PC, autoaim is superfluous. newlinechar  newlinechar A few other points, in addition: a high end PC is graphically superior, with the availability of much higher resolution than a TV can provide, as well as higher res textures and MUCH more antialiasing and anisotropic filtering (AA removes jaggies, AI makes textures look better at an angle). newlinechar  newlinechar Mods are great, digital download is more mature, and indie games are easier and cheaper. You can use a joystick if you want, or all kinds of wonky controls, or an xbox controller. Doesn't matter. You can hook it up to your TV, if you want. newlinechar  newlinechar There are two tradeoffs for this stuff, that make it an argument rather than a blowout in favor of the PC: price and simplicity. A high-end gaming PC customized the way you want it is complicated and expensive. You will have more bugs, and you will have to manage settings for your games. That said, the RTS genre is only playable on the PC (console RTS games like Brutal Legend and Halo Wars are an entirely different experience than Company of Heroes or Starcraft).

I think the OP's original definition applies more directly to the 5th and 6th Amendment.  Reading through the definitions of habeas corpus, though, it gives you the right to challenge the legality of your detention.  In criminal procedure, I think you have to have an indictment and then the Grand Jury decides if the indictment sticks.  It seems like the writ of habeas corpus then, just forces the normal process of indictment and Grand Jury so it's not directly the right to be officially charged, but ensures you can ask for formal process if you didn't get it.  The OP's post is indirectly correct.
Never has a rick roll been so subtle around and hurt you.
Great point. As far as i know, Ford had written a book called 'The Modern Jew' which served as an inspiration for Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' (My Struggle). At one point Hitler considered to award Ford the highest possible award for a non-german but Ford was wise enough to decline. Watson, then-ceo of IBM actually accepted this award and made good business with the Nazis selling them calculation machines (or computers) which they used, among other things, to deal with the complexity of running death camps. (These machines were called [Hollerith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) machines, btw.) newlinechar Watson is quoted to have said something along the line of 'if the Nazis win, Europe market is open to us, if not, we just continue business as usual'. newlinechar  newlinechar I could go on and on.

More repetitive than Assassin's Creed 1 (though I actually love THAT game), god-awful AI, no PURPOSE to your actions, a wafer-thin plot,  uninteresting gunplay and travel, main missions did very little to differentiate themselves, the partner mechanic was extremely shallow.. the list goes on and on.
My oldest already mostly attracted to older women. I don't have a problem dating younger men as long as they're men and not boys. Once we hit a certain age difference they start to remind me more of my kids than a potential partner. Perhaps it would be different if I had daughters but I don't, I have sons.

I assume you are making an oblique reference to the writers strike?  The movie could have been so much better if they had the chance to tweak during filming.
I don't think it will stop me from intervening in the future, but I will be more mindful of the risks and more careful. If any one of the people I confronted had pulled a knife, I would have been in deep trouble.
1. concerning illegal acts (including bestiality): committing crimes puts you directly at risk.  If you know about it, you could be considered an accessory to the crime.  Even if you don't face elgal troubles, the danger of conviction could place any joint finances in danger.  I doubt listed sex offenders find gainful employment.  Further you would have no need to discuss many of these offenses would mean an instant end to the relationship.  You would not stay with a man who you found molesting your dog, or child for that matter. Criminal and abusive behavior is grounds for separation and is a very different concern from fantasy. newlinechar  newlinechar On transgressive porn and erotica: so long as an illegal act was not committed in the production of the porn, it is okay to have and enjoy it.  Consider that the series Twilight.  If the reaction to it and paraphernalia sold around it are any gauge, it is porn.  It is porn about a much older man stalking and grooming and finally impregnating an underage girl.   newlinechar  newlinechar Or for a much higher-brow filth, look at Anaïs Nin's Delta of Venus.  A lot of that is criminal and it was meant as stroke material.  The transgressive nature of the works lend to their eroticism.  That doesn't mean the audience would allow such behavior in real life. A crime is not a crime unitl it is committed.  Fantasy is a safe place to explore those parts of ourselves that we would never let have free-rein. newlinechar  newlinechar Not only are you allowed to explore your darker elements in fantasy, you should feel it a duty to do so.  Understanding yourself makes you a better person.  It allows you to better understand others. newlinechar  newlinechar Infidelity:  Fidelity is a sacrifce you choose to make to another, though it is tacitly expected in our society, and I myself would give it,  I think it is wrong to demand it.  If it is offered it should be treasured for the great gift it is.  It should not be as it is, it should not be mundanely assumed.  So long as they are honest in their intentions I do not tell those I am in a relationship with what they can and cannot do with their bodies.  I can hope they choose monogamy, but I will not demand it. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. newlinechar Yes this freedom extends to many things.  Your beliefs are your own.  Your body is your own.  How you dress, what you read, how you vote.  I have no say in these things.  What I do have a say in, is things we share as a couple.  Our time, Our home, Our children, Our money. newlinechar  newlinechar Your notes: considered disagreement is not insulting.  Flippancy is.  You were not remotely flippant.  I take your intrest as a compliment.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Clicked your post expecting something interesting &amp; everything you wrote, other than the title is either 'defensive' or 'dumb stuff'. newlinechar  newlinechar While I respect those who don't use credit, how exactly is saving 2% on every purchase and enjoying a fairly decently improved return policy 'dumb'? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;People love to defend their stupidity, even when it wasn't under attack in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar Now THIS is ironic!

Well said... but it is not academic terms I am referring to as mutually understood definitions tend to be a prerequisite for legitimized communication in highly specialized sub-set (e.g. academia). It drives me batshit crazy to hear people use a word **WILDLY** incorrectly, but defend their use of it by noting that 'most people' would agree with their 'sense' of the word. Being wrong as a group and knowing it, doesn't suddenly make the choice to embrace ignorance any more valid. The fact of the matter is, one can master one's language or be  mastered by it. If the people in question insist on using words incorrectly than they probably didn't have too much to say in the first place. Communication without articulation is verbal masturbation.   newlinechar  newlinechar On a more topical note, I do not bother trying to define amorphous social terms like 'conservative' and 'liberal'. Suffice to say that we have a uni-polar two party system made up largely of brigands and selfish fucks. Not matter what color you paint shit... its still shit.   newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover, we are now a nation of issue-voters which makes our castrated parties into unwieldy tools which are at the disposal of the rich. We are being loosely corralled into this false dichotomy in order to keep our vote under control. But then... I still vote. heh

You jump out of both sides of the aircraft at about the same time (the book says 1/2 second apart).  It just happened close enough for the other guy to grab it.
&gt; Suppose the logic loop updates the position of an object, but not another... do you just draw the scene with the objects temporally in the wrong place? newlinechar  newlinechar You can double buffer object position the same way graphics are double buffered. For each object, you store the current and next positions. You incrementally calculate the next positions. Meanwhile, the graphics code is always reading from the current position. Once all next positions are calculated, you flip them and make the next position the new current position.
It often leads to a leapfrog effect, which turns real bad, real fast.
This sort of thing has cropped up before and it has always been due to human error.

The serious followup is nearly as good: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The illegal act of copyright infringement definitely harms us as a company.

If we were to include restrictive DRM in Achron, it's virtually guaranteed that someone will crack the DRM and illegally distribute Achron anyway. In short, we believe that restrictive DRM harms the paying customer and does little to protect against piracy. newlinechar  newlinechar Why oh why don't the big studios get this?

&gt;Seriously. I'm frankly amazed that that online porn industry hasn't simply imploded these past 5 years. I see little value-add in most sites. I fail to see how anyone makes any money at all even hosting a site. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it is imploding. The logic was 'more traffic=more sales' and the easy way to get more traffic was to give away more explicit stuff. But people simply gave too much away for free, it's like running a restaurant and giving sandwiches away at the door.  newlinechar  newlinechar But it will eventually come full circle. Photographers will stop shooting because they can't afford to pay the models anymore. People will eventually get tired of crappy tubes sites all showing the same shit. And then a new generation and new business model, probably with new technology, will come along.   newlinechar  newlinechar Some people will feel its not as satisfying as it used to be but then there are some of us that feel that free internet porn was never as gratifying as the magazines we used to steal from the newsagent when we were 13. newlinechar  newlinechar stuff changes

Which is why I used the term 'anything' rather than 'something.' Asking why there is something is valid, as long as by 'something,' you mean more than just 'the opposite of nothing.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Why are there galaxies?' is a valid question.

Java applets are designed to be ran from the web browser and are severely limited on which systems resources they can access --this is called the sandbox, since they can't modify anything outside of the sandbox and affect the regular operating system. newlinechar  newlinechar Java programs can also be launched from the web using Java Web Start, this allows the java programs to function as full programs (even installing a desktop icon if desired) with access to system resources.  newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of online games use java applets, although most online games now use flash.

I use both regularly and find both have their inconsistencies. Excel's copy/paste and window close behaviours are maddening, for example. A lot of the time though, I'm finding myself tending to use Calc for the bulk of my work and only opening Excel when there's something I'm more familiar with there than in Calc (A decade + of Excel...). newlinechar  newlinechar One thing I can say for certain, if something really annoys you in Open Office, it almost always can be fixed. In your case, for example; newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Pet peeve: A modal dialog every single time I hit delete. &gt;_&lt;  newlinechar  newlinechar You can use backspace instead, or if you really want the delete key to work the same way as in Excel, change the default behaviour in Tools\Customize, Keyboard tab.

Did you try 'Save as'? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Calc isn't Excel, though much of it is compatible. If you can't get used to the little differences or spend the time to customise it to work the way you want, you'll always be better off sticking with with Microsoft Office. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But don't make the mistake of thinking it's a bad tool when it's just not YOUR tool.

1. I said it takes a super natural force to become saved.  This is different to believing, or most importantly, saying that you believe.  I mentioned the point more because a lot of 'Christians' have forgotten the distinction, but to answer your question directly, God does have influence on non-believers as well as believers. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. My mother is a Christian, and took me to Sunday school when I was very young.  This makes it difficult for me to answer that question as I have been told God existed for as long as I can remember.  Being saved is pre-dated by believing, so I guess the answer is no. newlinechar  newlinechar At the time, I was not actively looking to change my life.  However, what I found was something which scared me into looking further.  In my experience God will meet with people who are looking for him (this is promised in the bible also), so the experience of your friends is consistent.

I second this. Typically the game state will be updated by the game thread and then mirrored to the render thread to do it's stuff. If the scene is graphics heavy, you might skip over a mirrored gamestate because the game thread did two updates while you were drawing one.  newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, if the game thread is slow then the render thread has to stall a frame until there is a new gamestate to render.  newlinechar  newlinechar Bam.

Despite frequent complaints about the hive mind, I have found that contrarian opinions are usually pretty popular here as long as they are well worded. People actually do like having their minds expanded. Hyperbole however makes people shut out the comment entirely.

All I see you doing here is making a 'one true Scotsman' argument.  Because you see how bad conservatism has been exposed to be, you're simply going to insist it's not 'real' conservatism. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt you would have made the argument in the 1980s when Reagan was president, and yet what we see today is an inevitable, inherent conclusion to the Reagan Revolution. newlinechar  newlinechar You can define conservatism to mean almost anything, of course, you can even play the 'conservatives are classical liberals' game.  But there's a political reality that has played out over decades and generations, and it has nothing to do with the self-serving rationalizations.  There's no connection between Edmund Burke and modern American conservatism.  That doesn't mean there's a 'real' alternative to American conservatism roiling under the surface waiting to be let loose, it just means *there's no connection between Edmund Burke and modern American conservatism.*  American conservatism is what it is, not what you want it to be or what it pretends to be. newlinechar

My concern with your original post is you conflate 'political philosophy' with 'politics'. There's also a US centric underpinning to your claim (I'm Canadian, and study political philosophy at a Canadian University). newlinechar  newlinechar The political philosophy of 'Conservatism' is about preservation, tradition, stability, and continuity. It does not include liberty as a primary tenant. The political philosophy of 'Liberalism' is about freedom and tolerance. Most of the western world has government founded on the political philosophy of Liberalism and has resulted in liberal democracies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, politics is another issue. This is where we get into labels and where American Conservatism is actually a branch of the political philosophy of Liberalism. These labels of politics, not political philosophy is what I truly believe you are concerned with. The politics that currently calls itself conservative in the US is not the politics of conservatism from 50 years ago (Call it Goldwater Conservatism if you'd like). newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise, the term 'liberal' is dragged through the mud in the US while the country's government is a [liberal democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy). This is due to politics which is separate from political philosophy; not to say they aren't connected, but it's the whole positive/normative-fact/value distinction. newlinechar  newlinechar So, I guess what I'm saying is that labels in the realm of politics are relativistic and depend on time and place (e.g. now vs. 60s, Canada vs. US). The branches of political philosophy are not as relativistic as they are more definitions. The politics of conservatives, liberals, and libertarians in the US are generally Liberal (that is under the political philosophy of Liberalism). newlinechar  newlinechar To read more on the political philosophy of Liberalism you can go to the moderns (Locke, Smith, Kant, Bentham, Mill) or the contemporaries (Keynes, Hayek, Berlin, Rawls, Nozick). People will say Keynes and Rawls are on the Left while Hayek and Nozick are on the Right, which are terms in politics; In political philosophy they are all Liberals. I'm currently reading Sen's Idea of Justice, which is in large part a critique of Rawls, but it's still under Liberalism.

I hear both is short talk during one of the evening sessions and one of his seminars. I think the problem with the evening talk is that either you knew who Shane Claiborne was and had already heard what you had to say, or you didn't know who he was and thus might have had a hard time adjusting to his personality. The seminar was better, because I think I knew what I was expecting more and he was clearer able to give out his views. (My friends were all big Shane Claiborne friends so I sorta knew what to expect, but I hadn't actually read any of his stuff.) The point I'm really glad he made during the seminar that I don't think Christian teachers make enough is that their views are just that -- their views -- and you are welcomed if not encouraged to disagree with them. It is a lot easier to accept radical views when you are not being told 'this is you should believe' but instead 'this is what I believe and why I believe it and I hope you at least considering it when making your own decisions'

Not much, DayQuil is the same thing as NyQuil except it doesn't have Doxylamine succinate in it. That's an antihistamine that makes you drowsy. It also contains phenylephrine if I remember correctly, which is a decongestant with stimulant properties similar to pseudoephedrine (although some people claim it doesn't effect them similarly).. I think most of the NyQuil formulations leave out the phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine now, except for the 'D' formulation.  newlinechar  newlinechar My college roommate, now a doctor, swore by the concoction of a DayQuil, a shot of whiskey, and diphenhydramine.

I don't think the teachers were pushing an agenda or doctrine, per se. They exposed the kids, through real-world experiences, to the ways that humans react to situations with limited, valuable resources. They encouraged the children to think critically about the perceived and real inequalities of such a system. They also noted that the 'have-not's projected a false image of cruelty and oppression onto the 'have's in spite of the kindness of the originally lucky ones to the unlucky ones. This wasn't a 'power to the proletariat' situation. newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, the kids learned something about sharing resources. The teachers didn't take away individual ownership of the products created from the resources, just restricted the kids who would otherwise 'hog' the good pieces from doing so. I don't really see how this is terribly different from the way the world works anyway.

You have to fight a lot of mind battles when you invest - a falling stock price, all else equal, is a great thing for a real investor, because it means you can get the same thing for a lower cost. If a stock was good at $5, it should be even better at $3 because you have an opportunity to buy it for even less. Human nature is the opposite, we instinctively place some value in what others think and so as a stock falls in price, we want to sell it, but that's the exact time to buy - when others are afraid. newlinechar  newlinechar I think you've actually got an edge compared to most people when it comes to investing, so use that to your advantage :)

When you do end up starting off with weed, you realize that 'wow... i am not dead, nor insane...' and this begins the questioning... newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe they were lying about everything else too? Maybe they all really aren't that bad? And that's when it begins... all that careful placed advice has been thrown out the window because you were not honest with your child. At this point most failing parents choose to project their issues, and normally its marijuana that gets to be the scape goat.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you were to explain things honestly, listen, marijuana isn't gonna kill you, its really not that bad for you, but if you do it too much or at the wrong times, you will lose your motivation &amp; drive to get ahead in life, could gain weight &amp; starting being generally lethargic. THEN when this happens, they say holy shit they were right, and either learn to control it or stop.  newlinechar  newlinechar And they won't think you were lying and put a needle in their arm either.  newlinechar

Bacterial infections secondary to viral pneumonia are not uncommon at all.  In fact, most people who died of the Spanish Flu which killed millions in 1918 were thought to have been killed by the subsequent bacterial infections.

Well, nothing tastes like water.  Not even high-end vodka.  Part of drinking is learning to (at first) accept and (later) enjoy the actual taste of alcohol.   newlinechar  newlinechar Until you get to that point, try 99 Bananas (smells exactly like banana laffy taffy, if you ever had that as a kid) mixed in orange juice (other tropical juices would probably work well; I've just tried orange).  Only put in a little, as it's 99 proof.  You wouldn't know you're drinking. newlinechar  newlinechar Once you start to man up, perhaps some still-fruity things like a tequila sunrise will work for you.  You might also enjoy a *good* white wine.  Don't bother with cheap stuff; generally, the cheaper the wine, the more the taste of alcohol dominates.  You might like rum and coke (*not* white rum, that stuff is nasty, go for something spiced or (even better) dark).  If you do it right, in terms of proportions, it's basically like vanilla coke. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I don't actually enjoy any of these cocktails.  If you want something that's still completely non-threatening but hard, try combining two parts tequila (at least reposado, anejo or above would be better) with one part good white/dry vermouth.  Almost no kick.  Mess with proportions as desired. newlinechar  newlinechar (General note: white vermouth is a fortified wine featured in many classic cocktails.  It is a magical mellowing agent that will make nearly anything taste smoother.  Noilly Prat is a good value and pretty great taste.) newlinechar  newlinechar If you like crisp, herbal tastes, try gin and tonic.  Be sure not to put too much gin in, and to use something good for your first one - Tanqueray or better. newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing that people perceive as threatening, but that actually is much more enjoyable and drinkable than most vodka- or rum-based drinks is scotch.  When you've gotten comfortable with the taste of alcohol itself, and if you find that you like, say, red wine or tequila or anything with a mellow, almost spicy taste, then buy yourself a small bottle of good scotch (or see if you have a friend whose booze you can try) and slowly sip some, with a small amount of water or no more than two ice cubes. newlinechar  newlinechar If you've still got hope for beer, try to find out if there are any local bars or restaurants that are known for a wide selection of beers.  They'll usually have beer samplers, where you can try a few varieties of beer in small amounts for a reasonable price.  It's a good way to look for something you like. newlinechar  newlinechar Would you mind telling me what you've been drinking so far?  If it's crap, then that'll probably be the reason.  If you don't remember all the brands, do you at least remember the type of beer (stout, ale, etc)?  I don't like most beer either, if that helps, but I do know a decent bit about it and have a fondness for a few types of the good stuff.  Edit: a friend who's more a fan of beer has suggested Hoegaarden if you want a nice beer. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry about all the parentheses.  Hope this helps!

Ah, then you're referring to what is called a 'sophisticated hyperbolic discounter.' Hyperbolic discounting is the way that behavioral economists model present bias (which was what I was talking about earlier with 'I want the cake now!' type of mentality). Basically, the idea is as follows. newlinechar  newlinechar A rational agent discounts the future at some rate, let's say D &lt; 1, so $1 tomorrow is worth $D today, it is worth $D^2 in 2 days, and so on. A present biased agent has a separate discount factor for 'today', let's call it B&lt;1. So $1 tomorrow is worth $BD today. But, $1 the day after tomorrow is worth $BD^2 today (so the B discount only applies to periods that aren't 'right now!') There's papers that motivate all this stuff with psychology and experiments, there's even a bunch of work on estimating B coefficients in various frames. newlinechar  newlinechar Why is this hyperbolic guy not 'rational'? Well, suppose he has a choice of performing a task (quitting smoking?) it has immediate cost of -1 and has benefits tomorrow of +2. Suppose, just to make things easy that D=1 and B=.25 (so he's really present biased). From his perspective the costs of doing the task today are -1 and the benefits are +.5 (so he doesn't want to do it) but from TODAY'S perspective the costs of waiting and doing it tomorrow is -.25 and the benefits are +.5, so what he wants to do is procrastinate and do it tomorrow, unaware that he'll come back to the same problem of 'ah, I'll do it tomorrow!' once again, well... tomorrow. This is what's called a naive hyperbolic discounter... he is going to eternally procrastinate and never get anything done. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, suppose he's sophisticated, that is, he knows that tomorrow he will be lazy and not do what he's supposed to do. Well, from today's perspective, he should do the task today... but, something that would be absolutely perfect for this agent would be a device that would guarantee he does what he's supposed to do tomorrow. newlinechar  newlinechar This situation isn't exactly 'cookies in the dark corner' but we could come up with something analogous to that.

Here in my dense neighborhood in San Jose with predominately 30+ year old homes, the smoke on still, cold days can be choking.

I thought D9 botched the whole analogy with apartheid, and ended up trivializing it with its silly B-movie approach. There have been much better films about apartheid (e.g. *In My Country*, *Cry Freedom*, *Catch a Fire*). I didn't think that D9 shed any new light either on racism or apartheid. Neither D9 nor Avatar are great movies, in my opinion, but I enjoyed Avatar much more than D9.

I got all of my flight ratings in college and majored in Aviation which was a bad move on my part. The degree is pretty useless outside of the aviation industry.

Ok  you just did not understand my post at all.

Now MacArthur was under direct order from the president to not go up the 38 if there were any sign of Chinese opposition there, which there were, MacArthur said fuck it we can take those commies and engaged them, which was a really bad move on his part because the Chinese did not get the memo about American superiority and had a very different opinion about that, so they pushed back in force and the rest is history.

&gt;The gameplay is the same, the weapons are the same, the strategies are the same. newlinechar  newlinechar No, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAHAHA NO THEY ARE NOT, and eh, a few strategies carry over, but otherwise no. newlinechar  newlinechar The guns are completely different from 1.6 in every single way. Damage, spray, recoil, and accuracy off the first shot. The game play is completely changed due to the weapon. You can dominate with a p90 due to it throwing off the person's aim more than is shown. If I get an awper in the small toe with a p90 bullet they're dead as I will easily mow them up with no fear of them being able to shoot me outside of blind luck. newlinechar  newlinechar Seeing how that's just a single example, and in 1.6 the P90 was worthless... yeah, completely different games. newlinechar  newlinechar Want another one? The AK47 was a laser pointer on the first bullet out of the magazine. Now in CSS the first bullet is also effected by random cone shaped bullet spread.

I didn't mean their inventory system before was perfect, but taking away pretty much all options as to how to equip my team is frustrating. Not to mention it takes away a large chunk of the perceived character ability progression. newlinechar  newlinechar And you are right, the mako is flawed by design, I was hoping they would change that design, not just remove it completely. You can't really say that the new system of scanning planets is any better. It consists of: newlinechar  newlinechar * Hold right click newlinechar * Move mouse until you get a hit newlinechar * Left click newlinechar  newlinechar And repeat forever. newlinechar  newlinechar A few new enemies with interesting attack patterns would have changed the mako combat strategy (ie: flying enemies, heat seeking weapons, suicide drones, etc.) the replacement simply feels like busywork. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the most frustrating portion of the mako however was the terrain on the randomly generated planets. It consisted of such an impassable heightmap that was clearly generated by clamped noise that no matter what you did you ended up rocking back and forth like a baby in a homicidal swing-chair.  newlinechar I believe that world generation problem was what they were actually trying to avoid, which is a bit of a shame because there are some really good procedural world generation algorithms they could have implemented instead.

Paint it Black - The Rolling Stones
&gt; Wait. Let's be real here. He is asking why they are expensive. newlinechar  newlinechar Indeed he is, so why did you take a statement I made about ease of use and apply it to the question of price? Leicas are expensive because they're made by hand, with expensive parts. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Aka, less customizable. newlinechar  newlinechar How is a Leica less customizable than any SLR? You buy a body and attach various lenses or other crap to it - every camera with interchangeable lenses and a flash shoe offer the same degree of customization. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The 5d has a better sensor. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course it does! The 5d body is huge and certainly has enough room to cram in the megapixels, but surprisingly it doesn't beat the M9 by such a massive margin. The M9 takes 5212x3472px (18mpx) large images and the 5dmkII shoots 5616x3744px (21mpx) large images - not really a big difference. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So sharp lenses on the leica are limited by the lack of detail the sensor produces. newlinechar  newlinechar This a poor argument that can be used against any digital camera ever produced. If you want to be nerdy about it you should check the MTF charts: [Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=152&amp;modelid=14259) [Leica Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH](http://en.leica-camera.com/service/downloads/lenses_for_rangefinder_cameras/summilux-m_50_mm_f14_asph/index.html) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Wow. Nice stretch. See, it doesn't have autofocus issues because it doesn't have autofocus. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't really much of a stretch at all, it's just logic. Because rangefinders have a different fundamental approach to capturing an image they allow lens designers to perfect a simple lens design rather than struggle with a complex one. I've never been too fond of AF and prefer rangefinder focusing, so I'm perfectly willing to trade autofocus for image quality. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's a luxury item because of the utility it had in the street-photography days of Cartier-Bresson. newlinechar  newlinechar I've covered this earlier, but if you want to get into the definition of luxury items let's compare the camera world to the car world. Porsche make about [100,000](http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/26/news/international/gumbel_porsche.fortune/index.htm) cars per year and Toyota make about [9 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4311878/Toyota-overtakes-GM-as-worlds-largest-car-manufacturer.html) - a ratio of 1/90. Leica is rumored to produce around 10000 M9s per year and Canon sold about [4 million cameras](http://www.canon.com/ir/annual/index.html) in 2008 - a ratio of 1/400. So does this prove that an M9 can be viewed as more exclusive and luxurious than a Porsche? Not really, but you exaggerated your point, so I'm exaggerating mine. For me, it's not even about owning a peice of luxury, it's about owning a machine I like taking pictures with. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; They are no longer a luxury item, no longer without competition newlinechar  newlinechar Remind me who else competes on the digital rangefinder market? The M9 is the only choice for consumers who are interested in this particular kind of camera DNA. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, they don't. When you compare format-to-format, digital wins. newlinechar  newlinechar Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when [processed correctly](http://figitalrevolution.com/2009/12/07/20-stop-dynamic-range-technique-tmy2-tmax400-pmk-kodak-leica/). I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Digital surged ahead of film in terms of color accuracy nearly a decade ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Color accuracy became a non issue as soon as computers perfected the art and expanded the possibilities. Any RAW file will be just as good as any scanned negative after both have been processed. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After all is said and done, I've come to realize that arguing RF against SLR is pointless. It all comes down to personal preferences that are informed by your particular brand of photographic philosophy. Personally, I appreciate the simple, yet precise and uncluttered approach to photography rangefinder cameras offer. Once I mastered the simple interface I realized that I was enjoying photography much more and I think it's because there is less camera between myself and the photographs I take. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Just to be clear. I agree that the camera is crazy expensive, but any M9 owner will tell you it's worth it (not to mention the massive backorders every major camera store has). If anything, Leica found the perfect price.

I'm always impressed by (some, certainly not all) atheists' comfort with abandoning the very scientific world view they claim supersedes the religious one. One of the first thing anyone learns in statistics is that correlation is not the same thing as causation. These people are not worse off because they pray, they're plagued by the same problems of poverty as any other poor area of the country.  newlinechar Secondly, the idea that praying or being religious would produce any material gains is repulsive to any sensible religious mind. What kind of crap god tries to bribe you into worshiping him with money? Not one worth following, that's for sure. Proven indicators of crime rates and shortened lifespans are, however, rooted in a few things: social and geographic mobility, low incomes, and poor education. Not religiosity. Nobody should be, or is, better off in a social or material way just because they're religious. Morally, of course, the goal of religion(s) is to raise one's moral footing, but in places like Mississippi that have huge uneducated, unemployed, and socially isolated and oppressed ethnic groups, you're going to have those problems. That's survival instinct and greed, not religion. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, people being poor and people having their prayers answered are totally separate issues. God gives us what we need, not what we want. It's up to us to react accordingly.

Look at Japan for example. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I was quite upset with the actual ticket sales and the prices that they are going at now (I think VANOC should have capped the prices in the auction), because a $22 ticket should never be sold for $200 even if event host is doubling down on his income... newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, I get to make connections and as a university student this is vital to me as in about 2 years, I'll be in the real world, looking for a job.  newlinechar  newlinechar Plus, it really is a unique opportunity, and for most people, a 'once in a lifetime opportunity', to host the olympics and to take part (however minor it may be) in an event on the world stage.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll be cheering for Canada at the games and hope that we all come away with smiles :)

You're right. I was hoping I wouldn't have to look it up. And unfortunately I misquoted, my apologies. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Shifting less than one day per week's worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food. newlinechar  newlinechar Quoted in the NEF's report- Re-framing the great food debate: The case for sustainable food.  newlinechar  newlinechar The original source they quote is a paper by Weber and Matthews (2008): Food-miles and the relative climate impacts of food choices in the United States' *Environmental Science &amp; Technology* 42(10):3508-3513 newlinechar  newlinechar I could provide numerous examples, but I'm afraid I'll have to dig through my papers. The debates around food are really extremely complicated, but the reasoning behind red meat and dairy is fairly straightforward. Basic food chain dynamics and biology show that in order to survive, creatures higher up the food chain require more base inputs. So for example, a pound of grain only requires a small amount of water over its lifetime compared to the thousands of gallons required to make a burger. In addition, you have to consider that plants remove GHG's from the environment, while animals add them to the environment. More specifically, cows release huge quantities of methane, another GHG which tends to receive much less attention.

I understand that this is a gray area concerning ownership.

Let's dissect your [other comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/awekf/what_does_being_libertarian_have_anything_to_do/c0jqrm1). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I do think that there is plenty of room for debate over whether a specific cap &amp; trade bill would have a meaningful impact on the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Excellent, given that all sides can agree that there is a problem and that anything can be done about it if there is.  Given that both conditions must be true in order to proceed, it can be demonstrated that there's enough reason to believe that one or neither condition may be true, hence no 'progress' in either direction. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But to argue that CO2 emissions are not causing the planet to warm is ridiculous in my opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This oversimplifies the question.  Yes, CO2 causes warming.  That's a simple, reproducible scientific fact.  What *else* must occur in order for it to be a *problem*?  First, it must have demonstrated negative effects which everyone can agree upon.  With Al Gore and the AGW yahoos running around like chicken littles telling us that the sky is falling and that the oceans are going to rise in tens of *feet* (they won't, by *anyone's* estimation except Mr. Gore's), that polar bears are going to drown (they won't, again, in anyone's estimation except Mr. Gore's) or even go extinct (Polar Bears survived in prehistoric times during periods where temperatures were much higher than they are now - they're adaptive enough to move to more southern climes), the hysterics become pretty hard to take seriously.  We also must assume that this relationship is more than a linear relationship, which is a *huge* point of contention between skeptics and others.  In order to achieve the numbers which would actually be *alarming*, the temperature imbalance caused by CO2 alone must be greater than that which is demonstrated by simple physics - it must be create *imbalance* in the climate system, which is something which has *never* been demonstrated experimentally.  It is very possible that climate is far more stable than we give it credit for and that there are net negative sinks in the entire system which nullify the effect CO2 has on it.  That is a fair supposition, and one which is unclear (despite the claims of consensus). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There are not 'two sides' to this element of the debate -- there's just about every scientist who has studied the problem, vs. a handful of fringe investigators newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The opinion polls of scientists which ask if Global Warming is real are biased in favor of the answer being the one that alarmists seek.  If you merely ask if increased CO2 creates a greater temperature, the only correct answer is yes (by physics), and not under contention by anyone (which is why the polls are so close to 100%).  A more accurate question is:  Will it create an alarming amount of warming - enough that something must be done about it by humankind lest drastic consequences occur?  That question would almost certainly yield much lower numbers of 'yes' responses - though pollsters don't want to ask questions like that.  The number of scientists who would align with Al Gore's ridiculous claims would be actually quite low, especially if they are educated on the subject. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Denying' Gore's brand of alarmism is the only appropriate course, given how fundamentally unsound it is [[one source]](http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton/goreerrors.html).  There's *plenty* of room for argument within the scientific community about the hypothesis that climate is a system made unstable by a given amount of CO2. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;vs. a handful of fringe investigators funded by the oil &amp; gas industry, like former TV weatherman Anthony Watts. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is untrue, in addition to being merely an ad hominem smear.  Agree or disagree with the points Mr. Watts brings up, not with where he does or does not get his funding.

I remember reading a book (book is in storage, sorry) about the history of the guys who worked at some airbase on the border between CO and UT who were working with the cases for the thin-man and fat-man cases. Some of the thin-man prototype tests involved putting a shell in the 'gun' barrel inside the prototype, then dropping the whole assembly from an aircraft into a hillside, digging it out, then measuring how far the projectile moved in the barrel. I remember it being like a foot or less. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There have been a number of accidents where H-bombs fall out of airplanes (the plane is on fire, collided with something else, whatever), and none of them have gone off. So I'm not worried about them going off by accident at all - because a lot of smart guys have gone out of their way to make sure it doesn't happen again. What worries me is that some dufus will screw up (again) and put another set of live warheads on a B-52 pylon and they'll end up getting sold to some scrap dealer 'by accident.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Part of what PALs do is to sense that they're in the proper environment for their intended mission. So a warhead off an ICBM could not be fiddled with to blow up on the ground, it would first have to undergo several Gs of acceleration, followed by zero-G before the arming mechanism would recognize it is time to arm. Or a bomb would have altimeters to measure how high it got, and free-fall sensors to detect it had been dropped. A bunch of stuff like that so your bombs don't go all Dark Star on you.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 24 is a bad show, with questionable basis for plots and it overwhelmingly preaches to the audience that torture works.

1. You have to consider the carbon that was released in the production of the plastic in the first place. Just because some of it is locked up in the plastic, much more of it was locked up a couple miles down before we taped into the crude that was used to make it. Refineries release carbon as well as tons of other potentially harmful chemicals. newlinechar 2. Not true. Some of it blows away from the landfill, especially light plastics like bags. Some of it is lost from the trucks that transport it to the landfill. Much of this lost plastic makes it's ways into rivers and eventually the ocean. Check out the article I linked. newlinechar 3. UV is only one thing that causes release of chemicals. Simply sitting in the ground is another. For example, BPA leaches into the contents of plastic bottles while simply sitting on the shelves. Another is PVC which releases DINP, DEHP, and dioxins (known cancer causing agents) into ground water as it sits in landfills. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;UV degeneration should not happen newlinechar  newlinechar Should being the key word.

Take note of the amount of unburied or exposed plastics littering the surface. newlinechar  newlinechar You approach this from the premise that Carbon is the primary concern, when in fact the biggest threat are the man made chemicals they release.

I totally agree with you. While this charlesbarkley dude is right about compound lifts, he seems to have a extreme case of tunnel vision. newlinechar  newlinechar Compound lifts, put simply, are the lifts that call upon multiple muscle groups for effort and stabilization. They're far more effective compared to isolation lifts, which you'll usually see being done on machines or free weights. newlinechar  newlinechar Some examples of compound lifts: Pull Ups, Dips, Squats, Deadlifts and Rows.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some examples of isolation lifts: Bicep curls, calf raises, hamstring curls, tricep extensions.  newlinechar  newlinechar While it is true that you will get the best results if you stick with compound lifts, form is extremely important, as they're easier to mess up which sometimes can lead to injury.  newlinechar  newlinechar Me, I do both compound lifting and yoga. I like the way Yoga feels, so I do it. As far as body composition though, my compound lifting has done far more for me.  newlinechar  newlinechar Best of luck! newlinechar  newlinechar PS. The whole idea of wanting to 'tone' is kind of outdated. You don't need to be afraid of getting 'bulked' from lifting, which honestly is impossible for most people without a dedicated diet, consistent heavy lifting and about 6-12 months.

 No your attorney couldn't say that, but in reality no one can tell you to do that. They are legality required to report you if you make a claim that your going to do something illegal. But from what the OP said, the lawyer wasn't advising him he might have known the OP was going to skip bail but cases like those are hard to press because of Attorney client privileges. Whos gonna report him the person he helped? He was doing something illegal technically but its a hard case to prosecute and would never end up with him being arrested or losing his license. A lot of lawyers do this, unitentionally and intentionally.

Possibly. For me, it's a tale of sustainability: newlinechar  newlinechar First Apple dropped support for my old Powerbook (Snow Leopard won't run on PowerPC.) Then when I finally needed to replace it, I got a $400 15' widescreen Windows 7 notebook, instead of a new 15' Macbook Pro that would have been *four times* the price. newlinechar  newlinechar At which point, interoperability just became easier when my desktop Intel Mac was running Windows. I can play games again; I was already back on Firefox (from Safari) for the plugin support; and iTunes actually has a maximize button on Windows. newlinechar  newlinechar So basically Apple gave me some good reasons to switch to OSX; but their 'the user is always wrong' attitude never gave me any reasons to stay. There are problems with OSX that Apple will never fix. newlinechar  newlinechar (As an aside, I'm convinced that this arrogance of 'the user is wrong' will be the death of Apple on the desktop - and it'll start from the top in media production. Their pro apps are bleeding out their customer base: Aperture has lost to Adobe Lightroom; the latest Final Cut is mediocre: massively outdated, unstable, still not 64-bit, still has no actual support for Blu-Ray. The iPad may be great - but their serious apps are a joke.)

Regulations help the powerful minority exploit the majority.

Listen, I get your point. I'm basing my view on the views of the majority while openly admitting that this of course does not apply to everyone, that is not bigotry.

Burton was only credited on one song on [...And Justice for All](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…And\_Justice\_for\_All\_\(album\)), which wasn't crappy like their new stuff.

From Puppets, to And Justice, to the black album, and the newer releases, they've all been stylistically very different from the next. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think their newer stuff isn't as good as the old because Lars' drumming never really evolved, James' songwriting doesn't have the aggressiveness it used to, and Kirk's love for pentatonics and the wah got boring.

Humans have a biological imperative of survival.  Above anything society or philosophy tells you, the real driving force behind anything you do, the real core of any motivation you have, is survival instinct.  As such, this means that whenever we judge anything, we are essentially judging how secure it will make us, or rather, how much it will help or hinder our chances of survival.  When faced with a scenario wherein there is a significant unknown factor, it makes more sense to go with the safe, calculable option instead of gambling survival for a mere possibility.  This  means in effect that as humans, we are afraid of the unknown (and as a side note, we aren't afraid of anything else).  Whenever we are presented with a situation, even a hypothetical one, that makes us question our own security (remember, security is being able to assure survival), we become afraid as a defense mechanism. newlinechar  newlinechar The scene in question, when considered in context, is a vivid message that portrays humanity as ignorant, and under direct threat from something that we aren't sure how to fight (read as 'something we *don't understand*).  Thus, so long as a person is suspending their disbelief about the movie, they will find the scene startling at least, and probably more unsettling depending on their personality.

More than a few of the couples had a choice third wheel who would come and hang out.  They would pay for everything for them and treat them really nicely.  
I think you mean gmork.
Yours can't? It's a pretty normal thing. If your penis can't support your whole weight, you should probably talk to a doctor immediately.
There is a perfect tab online for this already. Google it and it should be the first result.
You're right. usually Chrome is covering it, lol.
That doesn't mean it doesn't get used.
Your reasoning is full of strawmen, baseless assumptions, displays a complete lack of perspective and is otherwise so utterly without merit that I feel engaging you would be like arguing with a can of pudding. Pudding is for eating (and later pooping out) but that is about it. 
I don't think you use your balls to put your touch it.
Moz, I've always been your biggest *flan*.

then maybe you could set it at 500...or 300.. or whatever..  i do kind of like this idea.
Well then I don't believe we can really continue this debate. We can't even agree on the language.   newlinechar  newlinechar Being able to voluntarily and permanently leave at will does not a slave make, no matter how many definitions and *degrees* of liberty you want to play around with.

this is probably it. Our brains aren't good at thinking abstractly, our minds are wired to interact with our immediate environment using our senses.
Soda point is a red herring. I am saying that Obama should reallocate the money to the 50 million in the United States who do not have food security, not saying I am sure he would do it. As a matter of fact, I am sure he would not as evidenced by the article. newlinechar  newlinechar So now that the irrelevant jabber at the top of your post is taken care of, let us move along and see how relevant your point is. Your point is maybe vaguely interesting, but not really and here is why. All of these things you say NASA does that is useful can also be done without paying companies to launch astronaut-filled spacecraft which is what the article says he intends to do. newlinechar  newlinechar If you need a satellite to help starving people, then by all means spend money getting that going. But drop altogether manned spaceflight and deep space masturbation until we can get our shit together down here (if that ever happens).
I needed Malwarebytes to remove the fake anti-virus software.  Of course I had to kill the malware first with run/taskmgr.exe because control alt delete didn't work... then I had to reboot in safe mode and update Malwarebytes because it was crippled...  sigh..

We had a few ladies who were exhibitionists, and they would really push the limits.  We had a few women touch themselves in public, and once when I was cocktail serving in the night club a guy just started going down on his woman.  It was really funny.

Sounds intense! I don't have too much weight to lose but i have a feeling this'll help with those last 10 pounds! 
I think it will make a stronger impact if you don't say anything to her.  Sending an ultimatum signals that you're still available, but why do you want to be available to someone who mistreats you. Continuing will just teach her that you are okay with being mistreated. 
I like it because it's really light on the CPU, fairly customizable in terms of UI and how your library is organized, and keeps the library updated to the second (I've been pissed off by media players that require re-syncs whenever you move a file, I don't recall if winamp was guilty of this). newlinechar  newlinechar The reason i switched to foobar after winamp was mostly the light CPU usage, winamp got heavy and slow for me now and then.
 yeah i think so

Totally agree. Putting a computer together is pretty easy, but those Intel heat sink clips are a fucking nightmare. I've installed a few of them, and every time I feel like they're going to snap.
Yeah, the search function has been broken for a very long time. I think someone set up a website to search reddit for us but I don't remember the url. 
Sorry about that, the auto-spam filter is way too zealous.  Wish I could turn it off and moderate manually.  I've unbanned that post.  Not too helpful at this point, I know, but hopefully it'll help the filter learn to not do this in the future.
I'm a server and also fairly new to reddit. Since I've been on I've seen a *ton* of topics about servers and restaurant behavior.
How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of 'Dog the Bounty Hunter'. :) newlinechar  newlinechar Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying 'oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k' -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes? newlinechar  newlinechar So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.   newlinechar  newlinechar Is that how it works??  
Thank you Jesuuuuusss!!1
[this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating#How_it_works) kind of explains how ice always has a very thin layer of liquid water on it.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also, what's the surface area of the blade's edge that touches the ice?  If you took someone like me at 845 Newtons and put it over a very small area, say .1 cm^2 i would have the pressure of 835 atmospheres.   newlinechar  newlinechar At my weight, if the area of the blade contacting the ice is .013 cm^2, i would produce enough pressure to melt ice.  So yeah..what's the surface area of an ice skate blade?

fantastic!  ran some errands, saw a metal show with my brother and my friends, smoked a little, drank a little, brewed some beer.  overall, pretty good.  :) newlinechar  newlinechar how's yours?
I have to disagree. I really like Phish and I enjoy some String cheese and I've never seen any of them live. My all time favourite band is the Grateful Dead who I've never seen but I can listen to live shows endlessly for days on end. I just love adventurous music without a net that goes places even the musicians never expected.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just to clarify- the reason I've never seen them live is because they've never come to Australia. God I wish they had.
Seriously though, news?  If he wants more commentary on the topic the daily show is fine.  I don't even see how the response is warranted.
My teeth are terrible, I'm constantly getting cavities and having to fill them. I wasn't preached at about cavities since I was a little kid, so I thought the problem just went away and I forgot about it. But I realized that even with regular brushing, sodas were murdering my teeth. Another perk that I look forward to, even though I'm sure a lot of damage has been caused already.

Actually it wasn't! The perils of relying on MS Word huh? newlinechar  newlinechar It would be equal to have 210 spots for everyone if Maori were equally represented socio-economically, as well as educationally (ie: poor results in high school etc). Whilst its easy to argue that Maori students should just 'do better', its not always that easy. The effect of poverty, or being poor in a relative sense, makes it very hard to achieve well scholastically. For example, if your parents are poor you will live in a poor neighborhood and attend a poorer school. Chances are you wont do as well as someone who is living in a very affluent area and has books, stationary, tuition etc all provided for them. You dont get to go to uni because your family cannot afford it (or you dont have the results), so you use your high school education, if you even have one, to get a poor paying job. Have kids, cycle repeats itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar By introducing the ability to provide free tuition or extra spots to students who make a real effort and come from a less than privileged background, the governments aim with this policy is to try and break that cycle. It may not be perfect, and relies heavily upon the individual to make the right choices and such; but its better than nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem was, this is exactly what happened previously. Look up the policies of assimilation and integration adopted by the European government.  newlinechar  newlinechar The major issue people dont seem to get it that Maori are not guaranteed a spot in the course. They still have to have the required academic results too. It is simply designed to allow additional students into the course who historically do not often get into these courses. Its designed to help alleviate the disparity between Maori and Pakeha incomes/living conditions (for lack of a better term) etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its fine to argue for equality, but be sure to remember how European settlers treated the Maori, as well as the subsequent government policies imposed, and ask yourself if that could have any future consequences.  newlinechar  newlinechar If we want to go to extremes, Pakeha are now the victims of racism. Just be glad you're not being shot, or given diseases, or having your land taken. :) newlinechar

I like to appreciate the things people will do in total sincerity, like going to foreign countries with no amenities and trying to help people that don't want them there.  There have been things they've helped with, things they've fucked up and I think that's its own discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar I appreciate their sincerity and their will-power. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree with saving nations when our own needs a lot of work.  I also agree with the idea that soldiers are trained to kill, they are not trained to save lives, that may be a side effect of the killing.  Killing is, however, their job.  That may be really simple minded, but that's what a military does.

He hit a female (glasses-wearing) TRU store director in the face with a pie. It was intended for a girl he had had a fight with but he just didn't have the heart to do it to her. He had the pie in hand, in the store and used the company phone in one of the aisle. He called the director to a certain area and waited. When she turned the corner, WHAM! the pie tin touched her nose. He didn't run, he just let what was left of the pie fall to the ground and walked out. The store director deserved it because she put him on a 'no-rehire' list.

You heard right.  It was a joint production with the BBC.

no, manufacturing and mining releases carbon.  there's a fuckton of oil in the ground.  that's carbon in it's most sequestered form.  using carbon is not good unless it uses atmospheric carbon.  that's what carbon sequestration is: taking atmospheric carbon and turning it into earthbound carbon.  if manufacturing plastic took carbon out of the air, it would be good.  but manufacturing takes carbon from the ground, releases some to the air via burning fuel to run the processes and puts some in the plastic.   newlinechar  newlinechar our problem right now is we've taken too much carbon out of it's naturally sequestered form, screwed up our planet, and now we're trying to fix it by putting the carbon back into the ground.  sequestering carbon is a good thing, but not taking it out of the earth in the first place is even better.  recycling enables us to extract less carbon from the earth. newlinechar  newlinechar so to be clear: newlinechar     newlinechar * releasing carbon to the air: bad newlinechar * taking carbon out of the air: good newlinechar * converting one form of earthbound carbon to another: probably releases some to the air newlinechar

The article is talking about UBS operations in Switzerland, not just in America. It wouldn't matter if they didn't open branches in the US; the US government would still be trying to violate the sovereignty of Switzerland only to gain a few short-term political points.
How about a statistical analysis instead? Using color change as an indicator of significance is misleading, even if the correlation seems evident. This is on the same level as adjusting the scale of axes to amplify innocuous differences.
Government *can*, when applied poorly, exacerbate any problem. Those on the left side of spectrum (like myself) would do well to keep this in mind always. newlinechar  newlinechar Some of us do understand that much of the policy schemes we come up with amount to an imposition. We are, I think, nonetheless certain that there exists a public good that should be expressed in the rules we design for ourselves as a society. I would love to see libertarians stop arguing about the philosophical underpinnings of government, and start using the policy we have every right to create in the aid of the less fortunate...even if its something like charter schools or the one realm where we agree: Foreign policy and the pursuit of peace.  newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, I think the reflexive focus on never ever ever admitting a regulation or tax has a legitimate use helps no one, even libertarians themselves. It makes brushing you aside easy. We just label you as unable to negotiate in good faith and largely an unreasonable lot. Not that that's fair, but this is politics.

Although I see what @gamblekat is saying, I don't think he's accurate.

because either the world will fall down and all anyone will care about is the scraps of carrion they can wrestle from the other crazed beasts or the modernization of the world will rapidly increase in pace with the internet all all that business which will allow people to realize that much of the insanity of the old world was due to out dated dogma which regardless of religion, political opinion, etc is quiet simply wrong - not saying people will absolve their religion and partisan preference but universally all the modes of thought will HAVE to include the new truths, such as how no one seriously believes in magic yet less than a hundred years ago many people seriously believed in occult powers and mystic love potions.  This process will increase and expand, the idea that a nude body is offensive will sound as absurd as ankle clips do today (for those that don't know an ankle clip is what stops under trousers separate from the sock so in the unlikely event of the lower portion of the dress being raised the ankle won't be exposed, this is but one of many, many devices used to maintain 'modesty' in repressed era england) - from the full length garments of not so long ago to the hot pants and oh so sexy short black dresses i see every time i'm out with the party crowds -we've gone from being 2inches of exposed flesh to 2 inches of concealed flesh.   newlinechar    newlinechar Head over to r/gonewild or yuvutu or xtube or any of the other sites that let people show off their nude bodies, they all contain a constant flow of nudity and ask (mostly) nothing in return - the most telling thing in my mind is the absence of heads in many of the pics, people personally don't mind sharing their nudity with people and yet they know that *society* might see it in a different light... That slow switch from prude to nude will happen on a society wide basis, maybe first the popular consensus will accept that people who want to be nude or exhibit themselves are 'normal' then they'll accept slower still that just laying around in the sun nude doesn't have to be a sexual thing....  or maybe it'll be a sudden flash moment and everyone will come out the closet together, nude beach popularity will soar and in a few short seasons the frequency of nudity on the beach, heath or sunbathing haven will grow faster than pokemon or yoyo's.  What ever happens, it will happen - we used to be scared to admitting we were animals because that made the world so much more scary, now we're starting to understand and revel in the beauty of ourselves and each other - elitist culture is being replaces by popular culture where rather than someone who tries their hardest to appear above humanity is less interesting than a jade goody character who was every bit as human as the day she was born.   newlinechar      newlinechar We have in short a world where people have been repressed for a long time, we're waking up and shrugging off the old world - how silly does it seem in light of thermo nucler war, water on mars, climate change,. democracy and all the other wonders the modern world dreams of to say that bare flesh is anything but bare flesh?   newlinechar    newlinechar A world where diamonds and gold no longer make sense, where information is free to everyone - all the works of the greats can be accessed in an [instant](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and every day more amazingness is added to our [world](http://www.ted.com/), where we all pretty much agree all humans are equal and  opinions differ.... can you really imagine this world revolving fifty more times around the sun and still anyone remembering why we found skin so scary to look at? will those sining demons or morality enforcing traditions which we don't even remember enough about now to understand still bite at societies bare ankles when we live in a post-hydrocarbon world? a world where robotics and AI (evolutionary CAD is ALREADY designing vital bits for NASA) have radically changed our concepts of work? where internet, VR, social networking, etc have totally changed the structure of society?   newlinechar    newlinechar I'm not Nostradamus but you don't need to be a soothsayer to see what's already happening in this world, i can't see how the fear of nudity could possible last fifty years, i'll be shocked it it lasts twenty.

i don't notice it very much, but as a stereotypical programmer who wears sandals all year round, people notice it.  kids are especially alarmed by it.  i was at a party onetime and this jackass was jibbering on about how the big toe is so imperative for balance that if a person loses it they're totally crippled, and everyone around him was nodding and looking very tutored on the subject and i said, 'i think that's not true.  behold!'  and i took off my shoe and sock and stood balancing on that one foot like a flamingo and commenced to telling the whole story of how this all came to pass (which takes a minute or two) all the while balancing on that one toeless foot.  it was a fucking showstopper, man.  those people wore expressions like i was defying gravity. newlinechar  newlinechar anyway, i was initially given a prosthesis by my physical therapist which consisted of an arch support with a stainless steel plate to provide some spring at the end of the foot.  it's the same thing he gave the college football players to prevent turf-toe (hyperextension on artificial turf).  it was too much trouble, so i never used it.  as such, my shoe is empty down there, so sometimes when i'm driving i go to hit the brake and whiff the pedal and have to take a second swing at it.

The natives are not forced to live anywhere, individuals can live wherever they wish.  I agree the 're-locations' were wrong, but how can we fix it now?  What if they knock up at your door saying, 'were sorry Mr. fearfuljesuit but this house now belongs to the Delaware tribe again.  Pack up.'

Americans spend money on many things, some of which are unarguably nonessential to their own or their fellow Americans lives. Yet some people seem to feel the best way to resolve the problems on earth is to eliminate spending for NASA programs. I think that is shorsighted and will not lead to the resolution of any of the problems for which they express concern. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I remember reading an interview with a poor farmer, I believe he was a farmer in Africa. He was asked 'Why aren't you saving so that you can plant future crops?' His response was 'Because my children are starving today.'   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Though America's industrial base has suffered tremendously, already, I don't think that we're at the point where we can't afford to prepare for the future and need to focus solely on the present. If we fail to invest in space exploration and preparation for the future, we can expect the American economy to decline even further. Then, the problems you see now are likely to be far worse.  As Malcolm X said 'The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If NASA's budget was eliminated entirely and the money was instead spent on social programs, it likely wouldn't make any great difference. The federal government alone spends nearly a hundred times more on social programs than it does on NASA. And state and local governments spend tens of billions more tax dollars on similar programs. So the impact on the poor from redirecting our space exploration budget would not be of tremendous benefit to the poor. By comparison, defence and homeland security spending is more than forty times NASA’s budget each year. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And, in the decades ahead, elimination of space exploration and the tremendous benefits that would have been brought to the economy from technological innovations spurred by the space program, would, I believe, lead to a poorer standard of living for the majority of Americans as other nations, with leaders whose vision extends beyond just a few years ahead to the next election cycle, would reap the economic benefits that might have been ours. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You say 'But drop altogether manned spaceflight and deep space masturbation until we can get our shit together down here (if that ever happens).' Do you really think that's going to happen in your lifetime or the lifetime of any children you might have? I suspect that you realize that there's never going to be a utopian society here on earth in the forseeable future.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm afraid that not preparing for the future will only exacerbate many of the problems already plaguing our society. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Hi son.
This made me pretty happy to be from Vermont.
I moved away after college to place where I didn't know anyone, so I know full well that saying to just go out and meet people is easier said than done. At the same time, I hope you realize that making friends takes a lot more than just a casual conversation in the elevator. If you're just having small chit-chat then it's not surprising that people don't seem interested in you. It's not just you; that happens to everyone. Have you tried meeting people with similar interests? You mentioned that you got a pilot license in another response. I think that makes great material for a conversation. I bet if you find someone who's currently in the process of getting his own license or would like to get one, he would enjoy talking with you.

I'll happily grant you the equivocation of terms with 'reason', not for any malicious intent, but simply because I'm not a phenomenal wordsmith.

Truly sorry!   newlinechar    newlinechar When it comes to baseless assumptions, I would say that while it does seem to be the case at first glance, I *myself* tried my hardest not to make any assumptions. My opinion toward the subject stems from my studies of philosophers, many of whom could be argued against in their own right. However, maybe there is something specific I could try to address? And that way, if I can't address it, I'll have learned that I did, in fact, accidentally make an assumption.   newlinechar    newlinechar As for philosophical misunderstandings, I would argue that all philosophers have multiple intents and multiple views of the world. The one that I, myself, would criticize is how I treated Nietzsche's hypothetical attitude toward his own idea of true nihilism (as compared to what I learned as 'soft nihilism', which is the attitude Nietzche opposed - that of thinking that if life is meaningless, we should stop caring about it). Nietzche was a proponent of embracing the meaninglessness and utter torment of life; but at least in my opinion, doing so is an indication of how humans cannot cope with facing this truth, and doing so on repeat for all eternity.   newlinechar    newlinechar To be fair, then, I would retract the part of my argument in which I incorporated Nietzche's belief. In this respect, I agree that this could be a misunderstanding and would be simply considered a fallacious appeal to authority.   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar As for the rest of the response, I would love to continue to examine particulars, in favor of further critique.

The difference in opinion on these issues comes down to two different interpretations of fairness. Both of you are concerned with fairness and maintaining/creating that balance of fairness in New Zealand society. One believes that it is *more fair* to take into account disadvantage and correct this to bring greater equality in society. The other believes it is *more fair* for no one group to be handed advantages over another group, especially based on race. One question to ask is which method has a greater effect for maintaining/creating equality in our society looking forward to 10, 20, 50+ years time.

&gt; One being the search server is too overloaded and doesn't work or returns incomplete results. This is not what historically people have complained about. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, I think that's exactly what people have complained about. Indeed, you've 'explained' the same thing several times now - if people aren't listening, it's probably because what you're explaining isn't what they're complaining about. So please, stop it. We *know* reddit doesn't search comments (although it seems that the 'mess' you fear so could be easily avoided with a 'search comments too' box). If it doesn't come back with anything at all, we can start blaming overloaded servers. When it comes back with an empty or incomplete list of titles, that's something else, and you should probably stop apologising for it - unless you're in a position to find the bug and fix it, but aren't allowed. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and as far as telling us all about history - whilst my username doesn't reflect it, I've been using reddit ('gwenhwyfaer' - indeed, I gave up on that account before it was even possible to delete them, so it's still there) since before there were comments, let alone subreddits; and I can assure you that search has *never* worked properly. Not from day one. It was an afterthought, and apparently it hasn't had much time spent on it since. Now you may be in the same position, in which case I'm telling you nothing you don't already know. But if you aren't... shhh.

I'm not going to say that the differences between 1.6 and css are not significant enough to matter, but it really is a matter of a few numbers being different.

Grenades were taken out, which were one of the defining characteristics of tfc.

One is deliberate indifference, which would be a violation under the 14th amendment (your example of guards ignoring rape).  The other is an action by the prison official (the childbirth example). If a guard rapes prisoners as a part of a policy, that would certainly be an 8th amendment violation.

&gt; How? Basically, it’s slow as hell. It uses a variant of the Blowfish encryption algorithm’s keying schedule, and introduces a work factor, which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be. Because of this, bcrypt can keep up with Moore’s law. As computers get faster you can increase the work factor and the hash will get slower.
Being submissive is very attractive to most masculine men.
Intelligence and self-discipline are not mutually exclusive. I am an avid procrastinator so I understand this correlation quite intimately. My laziness downplays my 'intelligence' but my curiosity and subsequent *fiddling and playing* seems to increase it. newlinechar  newlinechar So people without tacit knowledge of things we regard as complex matters are seen as stupid, yet have similar capacities as we do. Therefore their growth has been retarded compared to peers in their age bracket.

&gt;Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when processed correctly. I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too. newlinechar  newlinechar First, your numbers are off. [Here](http://imgur.com/EN9bo) is a chart I compiled a while ago from DxOMark sensor tests. The numbers in the dynamic range column represent values from the logarithmic scale (Aka EV values or stops). newlinechar  newlinechar You choose to argue the single area where film is superior (dynamic range) but leave out noise and color, and misrepresent resolution. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is, digital clearly wins in terms of noise and color. Overall, the quality is higher. [1 - 35mm](http://www.normankoren.com/Tutorials/MTF7A.html#Wilkins_tests) [2 - medium format](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml). I also saw a 1ds II vs velvia test in PopPhoto several years ago that gave similar results.  newlinechar  newlinechar Whatever - the point is, digital is *clearly* superior in terms of image quality. Aka a far cry from your original statement: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Scanned negs still beat the shit out of digital newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong: I love film (I use my Yashicamat 124g to shoot 120 chrome as my point-and-shoot), but it is *far* from superior - visually and technically. The exception, of course, is 4x5.
Maybe not where you are but in Australia stray, feral and even domesticated cats are a menace to the native wildlife. Sure there are introduced birds that cause problems too like the Indian Mynar and the Starling but not a lot can be done about those. newlinechar  newlinechar The issue is this. Cats are _domesticated animals_. By all means have a cat as a pet and do the responsible things like having your pet desexed and vaccinated and keep it inside at night. newlinechar  newlinechar Stray cats, ie. those who have been neglected and/or abandoned by humans are a huge problem and should not be fed or housed (unless you are prepared to fully adopt and take responsibility for)... I have trapped and shot many stray cats and know that it does not take long for a cat to become wild. One they are wild there really is no alternative but to destroy them.
Perhaps you mean 'ignore the guy who has a difference in opinion because I think weed is cool regardless of how it damages society'.

I'll be brief as I'm about to head out for the evening.  First, your 'macroscale' section paints with some rather broad strokes and uses language that is rather vague such as 'The world started in pure reason, perfect order. Then it exploded.'  The truth is, we have no idea what the conditions were prior to the 'big bang.'   newlinechar  newlinechar Then you say 'Then things formed, and when things are formed, things break. Randomly. newlinechar More things still form, but many more things break. Entropy. newlinechar Eventually, there may well be a time without order, without reason; a time in complete chaos. newlinechar That I can see what you wrote, and consciously, physically, and intentionally reply tells me that we are not there yet. There will be no reason for any atomic movement in complete chaos.' newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to want to borrow terms from physics, but you don't use their technical definitions.  Instead it comes off as some kind of psuedo-Eastern philosophical poetry. newlinechar  newlinechar Then you move to 'Microscale' and appear to invoke the hypothetical 'state of nature' as an actual anthropological description and assert it as a fact of nature.  The section continues 'society and genetics may even out completely. Everyone will be, act, and think exactly the same.'  Frankly I have no idea what you are trying to say with this and the remaining passages, though I agree that you seem to have Nietzsche confused.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you would like to clarify your argument further, I will take a look again when I get time. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I just highlighted the parts of the report which I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to talk about. Their forecasting technique is an obvious non-disclosable entity. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It mystifies me how/why a store that consistently sells out of product X won't simply stock more of product X until it stops selling out of it. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a logistics problem. Missing a sale costs Target some amount of profit. For Target, that profit is less than the profit on each item, because its demographic will just come back; for Walmart, it's closer to the item's profit.  newlinechar  newlinechar Stocking too many of a product also hurts Target. They have to buy larger shipments, hold them in their warehouses, use more personnel hours, and distribute them using more trucks. Those costs add up. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Seeing empty shelves doesn't make me want to buy other stuff in a store; it simply makes me curse the waste of time and gas and want to shop elsewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar Target's main logistical goal is to both increase in-stock levels and decrease warehouse inventory levels. The former appeals to more customers; the latter reduces their warehouse capacity needs. But the goals hurt are almost mutually exclusive - almost, because Target can do certain things to benefit both. If it wanted 100% in-stock, it's warehouses would have to be huge. If it wanted almost no warehouse space, it's in-stock levels would suck. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard for Target to do because the problem is deeply quantitative and requires a certain creativity that Target does not excel at.

Haha, I wouldn't even know where to begin. I probably started early 2001, so that is about 9 years of continuously play. That's roughly 78,000 hours if I played all 24 hours without a break. At first I played 5-10 hours a day (because was a teenager with lots of free time), but as I went to college and got a job, I played less and less. My usual playing time is anywhere from 40 minutes to 2 hours a couple of times a week.  newlinechar So, I would estimate it as no less than 5,000 hours and no more than 15,000 hours.

This is true, but the key difference between the way conventional publishing and POD publishing works is outlay.  It's a big investment - and a risk - to print thousands of hard copies of work by an unknown author (or even a known author).  Therefore the vast majority of submissions will never make it.  Most of them are probably shit, but there must be some gems that slip through the net.  As well as potential gems *after* a decent editing. newlinechar  newlinechar With POD you have minimal outlay costs, except for marketing which can be done much leaner, meaner and more targeted if online plays a big part.  No mailing out hardback editions to dozens of reviewers, you can just pdf them/zap to their Kindles instead.  You can target niche audiences better.  You can use social networking.  newlinechar  newlinechar But the issue is that currently there's a lot of stigma with this type of approach, as seen in your expression:  'then they become actual publishers'.  Surely they are already publishers?  The only difference is the process - and yes, POD/vanity/online publishers do need editors - and the prestige. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, this new wave of publishers would need to be discriminating as they became mainstream.  But I think another opportunity missed is the amount of potentially talented editors out there who could work on a remote or freelance basis.  So I expect that they would have a much higher acceptance rate than conventional publishers.

This is a thing [trend?] that seems to have just bent right around my existence.  Growing up and all the way through college, the hipster around me did not like science fiction at all.  They would sometimes be interested in certain movies or shows, particularly if they had 'so bad it's good' value, but none would ever be caught dead reading sci-fi blogs.  I keep being told that hipsters are into sci fi now, I just never see it. Perhaps that's why I'm so put off by io9.
I worked help desk at a large university that had this same policy. It was the bane of our existence. First someone calls and is pissed off because their password isn't working (it's never that they forgot it, someone it's always that the system messed up). Then we get a nice earful after they realize that they can't use the same password again (yes, this same person that insisted they were typing their password correctly before, now actually *is* typing it correctly when they try to re-use as their new password. Oh the irony). newlinechar  newlinechar The only argument for this policy I can see is a case where someone gains access to an account and uses it in such a manner that the owner of the account doesn't notice someone else is using it. After (at most) 3 months, the intruder no longer has access. However, I fail to see how this case justifies forcing 80,000 people to change their password every 3 months.

In response to your edit, I am *not* just burning these bibles.  I did burn one, but that was for (mostly) practical purposes.  I am looking for something more constructive to do with them that also fits in with my atheism.  Anyway, here's my response to your statements: newlinechar  newlinechar The Gideons give bibles to anyone who asks for them, regardless of their motives.  I certainly don't doubt that the Gideons would be very unhappy with my use of their product.  But they are, ostensibly, giving them to me by putting them in my hotel room.  If someone was handing out Nazi (or creationist, or Velikovskian, etc.) pamphlets and they sincerely believed what was in them, would you have a problem with people accepting them and then using them to create an exhibit mocking those beliefs? newlinechar  newlinechar I think everyone, superficially, has a problem with desecrating books.  But can you honestly say that *every* book ever written deserves preservation just because it was printed?  I'm currently reading *Exploring the Levels of Creation* by Sylvia Browne.  It's absolute rubbish.  Reading it sheds some light on pseudoscience and the human condition and little else.  I would rejoice if all record of it was wiped from the earth.  I wouldn't advocate that it be illegal to print and distribute, though.  However, I think I should be allowed to do what I want with my copy of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not in total disagreement with what you're saying.  Book burning and desecration is a slippery slope.  I don't believe I'm doing this just for the purpose of desecration, though.  I would hope that what I choose to do with these bibles will show that the bible is no different from any book and that questioning it or discarding is not something we should fear.  And I'm certainly not advocating that it shouldn't be allowed to be printed or distributed.  I do appreciate your criticism, though, and I sincerely welcome your response.

I think you can argue that those who choose the earlier material over the later material are making a less rational choice than those who consider the later material as superseding the earlier.  So when Jesus says 'Moses taught this, but now I teach that...', he's explicitly issuing updates that are supposed to take precedence. newlinechar  newlinechar But mostly, I think it's that a great many people consider their religion a kind of club, and they look down on anybody outside the club.  So they find a passage about stoning gay people, but they ignore the part about 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone'.  People like Mr Rogers considered his religion as teaching that there's only one club, with 6+billion members.  There was nobody on the outside for him to look down on.

&gt;I may be blissfully unaware, but could you point to me a time in history where there has been a shortage of unskilled labor, thus implying full employment? newlinechar  newlinechar Due to more complicated economic reasons, the US Government (or the Federal Reserve, for that matter), won't allow the unemployment rate to go under 5.5%. So just take that number as the lowest possible unemployment rate (you can read more about that subject here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU ) newlinechar  newlinechar From 2004 to 2008, the unemployment rate went under 5.5% to 4.4% in October 2006, then proceeded to climb until today. Starting in 2005 (or it may have been 2006, I don't quite remember), the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate to combat the low levels of unemployment (and to avoid inflation, more on that under the NAIRU entry).  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What do you mean, exactly? newlinechar  newlinechar What I mean is that the employer doesn't always have the bargaining power. In boom economies, employers often have to offer higher wages to get better workers to compete with. In recessions (even minor ones), the employer has higher bargaining power because of the excess labor.  newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom line is that the employer won't always (and they usually don't) have the power to keep wages low (or at minimum wage).

I disagree, your definition is too narrow and you are considering only one manifestation of passive aggressive behavior.

I don't know about you, but renewables are not economically viable. As a nation, we already burn a ton of coal for our power -- is researching to improve this a bad thing? If research into carbon sequestration and sulfur scrubbing can make a huge difference on our overall CO2 emissions as a nation (and use electricity generated from this instead of burning gasoline), maybe that's a better solution. Incremental change works, and just because Clean Coal currently doesn't exist doesn't mean we shouldn't fund research for it.

You gave a reason for engaging in armed combat; that doesn't in any contradict his point. He gave a condition for pre-*dulce et decorum est pro patria mori* warfare: that it would only be provoked by a group of people who knew they would win. You asserted that history contradicts his point then failed to defend your assertion. You spent the rest of your comment on tangents about motivations for violence and economic systems, neither of which even addressed the topic at hand.

I don't have a problem with cows and how much they fart.  I don't believe I have ever heard a cow belch, it must come up with the cud. newlinechar  newlinechar But when you see pictures of the pollution from vehicles in the bigger cities in China, Mexico and India, I feel that the people claiming that cows are responsible for the bulk of the greenhouse gases must be smoking some really good shit. newlinechar  newlinechar Especially when you consider the American Bison having the same type of digestive system, and they used to be able to travel by train for days, and never leave a single herd.  I have yet to see a feedlot  that it took more than a few minutes to pass.  Yet cows are supposed to be responsible for all of this, and it isn't the vehicles.  O.o newlinechar  newlinechar I have heard of many people who use goats to do mowing like that, but geez... goats are destructive little bastards.  In fact, there was a story last year about someone that had a little double decker trailer that flipped while full of goats, and from my understanding, most of the goats were either killed or had to be euthed. newlinechar  newlinechar There are places that have that kudzu vine growing, and that stuff is supposed to make pretty good feed stuff for goats, and if it is good for goats, I imagine that it is pretty good for sheep.  Maybe if you are in a kudzu infected state, the state would pay you to graze it down.  It would provide a free feed, and if you kept the gals pregnant, then you would have lamb crops.  Eh, get a ram to keep them pregnant, anyhow.  :P newlinechar  newlinechar There is such a thing as portable pipe corral panels that would work really good to keep them contained in one area.  There are such a thing as goat and cow panels, which while they are lighter weight and would be easier to move, because they are lighter weight, if a bunch of sheep ran at them at the same time...  they could probably knock it a pretty good ways.  Sheep have more of a tendency to spook and run as a flock.  Don't know if you have sheep handling dogs or not.   newlinechar  newlinechar The problem isn't going to be transporting them or putting them in people's yards.  The problem is going to be catching them and putting them back in the trailer.  Sheep run fast, they turn fast, and they weigh enough that if you try to catch them in the middle of a field, they can just about bowl you over while trying to get away.  :)

I think you could describe this, at least from a technical standpoint, as [subliminal stimuli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli). newlinechar And to be more specific, I'd say this would be: subliminal or unconscious visual stimulation affecting conscious thought. newlinechar Also, these are interesting summaries of journal articles about this subject:   newlinechar  newlinechar **[Priority of face perception during subliminal stimulation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0G-4JT9CSC-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=07/10/2006&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1187967307&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0ee1d2d5cf488a2e0b74cbd05e79f54d)**   newlinechar &gt; We developed a new method of color-opponent flicker (COF) stimulation, and investigated behavioral responses for object discrimination at the around threshold frequency of COF stimulation. Pairs of figures, a face, flower, the letter “G” and a random pattern, were drawn with a red and green checkerboard with a black mesh. COF stimulation was produced by presenting pairs of figures alternately (red–green–red–green–) at various frequencies (30–120 Hz). A discrimination task for objects during COF stimulation was performed by 16 healthy subjects. Threshold frequency of COF stimulation was between 50 and 75 Hz. The accuracy rate for face discrimination was significantly higher than those for other objects (p &lt; 0.01, ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD multiple comparisons test). The present COF stimulation technique could be useful to investigate subliminal processes of the visual system, and the present results indicate a higher sensitivity and selectivity for face discrimination than those for other objects. newlinechar  newlinechar And this is in image so I can't copy paste:   newlinechar **[Subliminal Visual Stimulation: A Study of Its Influence on Subsequent Images and Dreams](http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1959/10000/Subliminal_Visual_Stimulation__A_Study_of_Its.1.aspx)** newlinechar

Sounds great, but many of the things on your list are luxuries and have to do mainly with consumer entertainment.  Sure I'm complacent about Koreans' ability to stream HDTV more efficiently or check their email faster in internet cafes.  I'll just be content to stream my non-HD video and wait an extra few milliseconds or two for my gmail to pop up.   newlinechar  newlinechar A few of your items would have great benefits for medicine, business, education, etc.  Compared to a third world country's capabilities, they're practically miraculous.  But the US will be able to do those things too, perhaps just not as fast.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think superior internet speeds will give one nation a significant competitive edge unless the difference is enormous.  My friend has a Corvette and I drive a Civic.  In a handful of situations his car will blow mine away but when you look at the bigger picture we have basically the same capabilities -- we can get where we want to go at speeds significantly higher than walking or riding horses.   newlinechar  newlinechar Would I prefer to have the best and fastest network in the world?  Sure.   But do I think it's 'shameful' that our high speed broadband network is not as fast as their high speed broadband network?  Of course not.   newlinechar  newlinechar Punching little old ladies in the face is shameful.  Having slightly-slower access to a profound technology--which would have been considered miraculous by every human being who ever existed before the last couple of decades--is mildly disconcerting at worst.

Oh no, you're right, the interest rates aren't part of the FICO calculation.

You don't have to give very much information to have a facebook account. TBH it wouldn't be hard for someone on the internet to figure out my name and address if they really wanted to.

If this wasn't there, one of their players would have just paid for another month, which they're likely to do anyway.

&gt; You are making the claim implicitly by stating that society has a right to control a given geographic region. That is the definition of ownership. newlinechar  newlinechar No. I am making an amoral declaration that property rights cannot exist unless society recognizes you as the owner. You cannot make a moral claim to the property because there can be no historical accuracy or verification to such a claim. You require societies construct to develop the framework in which those rights can exist. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Like I said, ownership and property are merely constructs used to outline a framework with which to handle conflict. But a conflict arises only when two parties have a dispute in the other's claim to ownership.Yes, but it is rather unlikely that anyone would be able to prove who the original owner is. When the owner of a piece of property is unknown, it might as well be assumed to be unowned. In which case, it can be homesteaded. (Like an abandoned house or plot of land, for example.) newlinechar  newlinechar Assumed by who? Who is the arbiter?  If I've lived on my land for 10 years then someone comes along and puts a piece of paper down and says its the 'deed' to my land.  Who decides if it is true?  You've changed your moral definition of property rights into one of legality. Legality, by definition, requires a Social Contract. newlinechar

'Mankind has invested more than four million years of evolution in the attempt to avoid physical exertion.

On book destruction: I'm not against book burning simply because it's a book and printed content somehow gets some sort of free ride, I'm against it because it's the destruction of information and ideas, even if the information and ideas are crazy. I'm of the belief that is someone says something crazy, you don't silence them, or their print. Instead, you refute it using your own free speech. Destroying Bibles to combat the radical beliefs of Christianity is futile. There are more Bibles in the world than people. I think your time and effort would be better spent spreading your own information and ideas, rather than destroying others'. Instead of going to the effort of destroying Bibles, leave an Atheist flier, pamphlet, or book. Fight ideas with ideas, not with fire.

Why do you think that? First, under ideal circumstances, we can vitrify the brain. Second, you don't have to preserve the brain in working condition... you just have to stop the brain information from being lost to entropy. In other words, you just have to preserve it well enough that given full nanotech, super sophisticated neuroscience, etc, we can some day go in and say 'there's a bit of braincell here such and such distance this other bit of braincell here and so and so remaining concentration of some neurotransmiter or other. Since it's in this area of the brain, that implies it was probably set up like this, which means given the nearness to that it was connected like so, etc etc...' newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't have to be preserved in working condition... Just has to be preserved well enough that all the king's superintelligent cyberhorses can put humpty dumpty back together again.

&gt;Jobs that you would normally consider 'unskilled' are all part of the process of gaining experience. After gaining said experience, it's easier to move up the ladder to jobs that require more and more skills. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm well aware of this. Again, I do not understand how this upward pressure on wages in booms you've described will work. I do not see how businesses will compete for the best janitor, since the marginal benefit of experience is tremendously small for jobs like I'm talking about, whether it be McDonald's, a manufacturing factory, or a stereotypical desk jockey.

I don't think I'm wrong, just measuring the exerted force at a different point. What is the force in the ropes in the picture on the left?

**artrea** is making the mistake of calculating the tension in the rope, rather than the net force required to support the entire system.  As the angle of the 'V' approaches 180 degrees, the force required to support the system remains constant (i.e., weight of the bags or friction pulling back on the sleds) but the tension in the rope approaches infinity (obviously snapping long before it gets there).

Someone who doesn't subscribe strictly to traditional definitions of 'fun'? newlinechar  newlinechar And it's law enforcement that should grow the hell up if they think cartoonish boxes screaming 'look at me!' are a threat worth wasting taxpayer dollars to investigate. Any terrorist truly wanting to cause death and destruction in America has countless better ways to pursue these ends than spreading attention-grabbing boxes around a town in Ohio no one had ever heard of. newlinechar  newlinechar What next? Will they start tackling people wearing white and black stripes because it makes them look like an escaped prisoner? Will they arrest men dressed in black because they were twirling their mustache near some train tracks? And if they see any old bald men stroking the fur of a white cat, no doubt the policy will be 'shoot now, ask questions later', right? newlinechar  newlinechar If you see a mysterious package left at an airport, you might call the bomb squad, or if you see something that actually *looks* like a bomb, you might call the bomb squad, but what you *don't* do is call the bomb squad over something that appears to be a child's prank in a place unlikely to cause much damage even if it *were* a real threat. At least, not unless you have some indication it might be sinister beyond 'well, it *could* be a bomb'. newlinechar  newlinechar You know what? Fucking *anything* could be a bomb. A backpack, a plain-looking cardboard box, a trash can, a pile of old rags, a busted-looking TV, a trash bag - *any* of these things could conceivably contain a device capable of exploding and causing damage to its surroundings, but it would be ridiculous to the point of *absurdity* to freak out every time you cross one of these things because it *might* be a bomb. It's simply impossible to account for everything that *could* be a bomb, so the best we can do is look at likely candidates, and a bunch of attention-grabbing boxes resembling a child's prank are *not* likely candidates. newlinechar  newlinechar If I were a terrorist and *really* wanted to scare the shit out of Americans, I'd go into public parks and start burying land-mines. I'd release a chemical weapon on a subway. I'd detonate a suicide vest in Times Square. I'd poison a school's water supply. I'd buy a shitload of cheap disposable phones and call in bomb threats to every school and public building I could think of. Hell, I could *snail-mail* bomb threats to every newspaper across the country, over and over again, repeatedly, and just to keep people guessing, every now and then I'd carry through on one of those threats. Oh, or I could even use the hysteria about these boxes to my advantage, spreading *hundreds* of boxes clearly labeled 'BOMB' all over major cities to keep bomb squads busy while the *real* bombs (in unmarked boxes, or otherwise discreetly hidden) go off throughout the day. newlinechar  newlinechar If I were a terrorist seeking to harm and frighten America, you can bet your ass my prime targets wouldn't be little towns no one had ever heard of, and I wouldn't be doing it with boxes designed to attract attention so they would be discovered before going off. And you know, terrorists aren't all that bright - the [shoe bomber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_bomber#Bombing_attempt_on_American_Airlines_63) tried to detonate his shoe *in his seat* instead of, you know, going to the bathroom or something, and [the Christmas Day Bomber from last year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_253#Analysis_of_explosives) apparently didn't know how to detonate his explosives properly, and instead mostly just set fire to his own leg. However, even these guys had gotten it in their heads that if you take out an airplane, you can kill a few hundred people all at once, *and* capitalize on Americans' inborn fear leftover from 9/11. newlinechar  newlinechar There are some truly scary things in this world, and people can be capable of great horrors, but if you start seeing bombs and terrorists in every shadow, you are only giving them the power, status and *fear* that they seek. This isn't to say that you don't treat them *seriously*, but that you keep your reactions within reason, and limit your reactions to real, credible threats. A bunch of cartoony boxes some kid could have made in an afternoon do not qualify as a credible threat. newlinechar  newlinechar . newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. - If any government agents are reading this, everything I have said here is hypothetical. I am merely speculating on what terrorists *might* do, and I have no intention of hurting or even threatening *anybody*. Please do not come to my house, waterboard me and transfer me to some foreign gulag via extraordinary rendition. And if you don't believe that this is all hypothetical speculation... er... frywad put me up to it! It's his fault!

Well, I can do a factor analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar Two common factors were identified. The first encompasses IQ, Poverty, Murder, Theft and Religiousness, all of which were highly intercorrelated. The second factor was Generosity and Divorce, which were not correlated with the other measures. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When I remove Divorce and Generosity from the analysis, IQ is the largest single factor (i.e. IQ has the highest correlation and predictive value over all of the other variables). The loading factor for IQ was 0.87 overall. Poverty had the second highest loading at 0.75, and all of the other loadings were medium strength (~0.6) except for conservatism and divorce (~0.4). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important to note that this doesn't mean IQ causes the others. It accounts for the most variance in the other scores and lower IQ is probably a large predisposition to engage in criminal activity and religion, but since all of the factors were highly intercorrelated there's probably a strong interaction (That is, environments where murder, poverty and theft are more common also lead to lower standardized test scores).

Sorry, I didn't see that in the paper, but even so, how do you propose people deal with the security issue of using cash?   newlinechar  newlinechar Because first of all, cash can be stolen - if you're carrying $1,000 in cash and it's stolen, there goes your money, there is pretty much no way to recover it, short of actually finding the guy who stole your money.  If you have a credit card and it's stolen, you report it stolen, the CC company freezes your account, and you can dispute any charges that have been made to it.   newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, if you buy a product with a credit card, the product doesn't work as advertised, the merchant refuses to allow you to return it, you can always take it up with the credit card company, and they will most-likely refund you the money.  If you paid cash, tough luck.

A friend of mine thought the premise was so cool he ended up studying the distribution of cenospheres around the globe. newlinechar  newlinechar He figured out that the bigger cenosphere precipitated out of the atmosphere closer to the Yucatan where the asteroid hit. So, it looks like an asteroid probably just ignited a big oilfield. newlinechar  newlinechar Nevertheless, I think it's awesome that a badass sci-fi premise was the original spark for Real Serious(tm) work that ended up getting published in *Geology*. newlinechar

Are you kidding?  I don't remember the Winter of Discontent in the late '70s but I've been told about it.  Corpses piling up because they couldn't be buried, huge mounds of rubbish in the streets attracting rats the size of cats.  All because some bloody-minded arsewhipes decided to go on strike.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I started work in the era when union membership was compulsory.  The guys from the (Engineers and Metal Trades) union were just tossers.  They'd come down to our factory and start agitating away, looking for any excuse to try to pull us out on strike.  In one place I worked, the staff actually threw the guy back out on the street because they got on well with management and didn't need his brand of aggro.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm all for unions that look after the vulnerable workers like the nurses but the breaking of the militant unions was the best thing that happened to industrial relations in 100 years.

These arguments always end in 'well then just go jailbreak your *x*.' This is a flawed argument. First, you've already purchased the locked-down product, so Apple is able to continue producing locked down products. Second, Apple is actively trying to stop jailbreaking, and its possible that they'll find the holy grail of locks which could even go as far as bricking jailbroken products. Third, jailbreaking seems to waive all warranty rights, including things which have *nothing to do with software modifications* including cracked screens. newlinechar  newlinechar The iPad isn't trying to be a smartphone. It's trying to be a computer. It's got the power, and hackers have reverse-engineered multitasking solutions. So why hasn't Apple been able to provide a much-desired feature? The people who want multitasking have voices--there is no doubt that Apple knows how people are disappointed with the lack of it. Apple is instead scoffing in the faces of the public, actively refusing to add support for this useful feature. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr: There shouldn't be a 'jailbreak it' step.

You are categorically incorrect. The central bank is the only legal entity to clear the balance between the banks.

A typical vet for small animals makes around 80-100k/year, and a vet tech makes less than 30k. An operation on a human costs tens of thousands of dollars, and isn't entirely uncommon. An operation on a dog costs 2-3k tops, and many owners are more likely to put their dog to sleep in that case rather than put them through the suffering. newlinechar  newlinechar Vets who want to make a lot of money typically work with exotics or horses, though it still maxes out around 200k. newlinechar  newlinechar Exotics pay highly simply because expertise in them is so rare, and the pets are often very expensive. For example, koi can cost several thousand dollars each, if one gets sick, you're going to pay to fix it. newlinechar  newlinechar Horses pay high for obvious reasons - again, horses are very expensive animals, so it's worth a couple thousand dollars to keep it alive. There's also big money in horse racing, triple crown winners need doctors too. newlinechar  newlinechar It's all peanuts compared to a cardiologist though, who typically make 500k+. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;People throw down a ton of money upfront for vets, especially because in those situation, its 'pay me or your pet dies' and in a hospital that is 'usually' an impossible scenario newlinechar  newlinechar Forgot to address this. In a vet it's 'pay me or put your dog to sleep for fifty bucks' In a hospital, they're mandated by law to perform the operation, the customer isn't given a chance to negotiate.

Okay, I meant tipping of course and maybe I should have said East Asians.

Just because I'm destroying bibles doesn't mean that I can't also spread my own ideas.  That's like saying you can only have a sports team that either plays offense or defense, but never both.  I take most every opportunity I can to offer up my views on science and rationalism.  I do like your idea of leaving an atheist flier, pamphlet, or book in a hotel room.  Whether I also take the bible from the hotel room is a separate issue.  One could certainly argue that it makes atheists look like jerks if they take bibles from hotel rooms, and one could argue that it is wrong to do so because those bibles weren't expressly given out for that purpose. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm hoping that taking some sort of action with these bibles will help to spread my ideas.  I'm not doing it just for the sake of removing a set of information of which innumerable copies exist.  Like I said in a previous post, I hope that I will show that the bible is no different from any other book and that questioning it, discarding it, or destroying it is not something we should fear. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, I'd like to emphasize that I'm not burning books.  And even if I were, I'm destroying books that belong to me (arguably...but would you have the same problems if I bought the book on Amazon?).  Of course it is wrong to destroy another person's book, but is it wrong to destroy a book that belongs to you? newlinechar  newlinechar Pre-post edit/TL;DR:  It's not like this is the last copy of the bible in existence.  I would have a problem with destroying that.  But this is something that people have a problem with destroying for reasons other than the fact that it's a book.  To them, it's a *holy* book.  To me, it's not.  I'm trying to figure out a way to demonstrate *that it's just a book.*

Never really bothered to try and make msn more usable. Depends on what you want from your IM client, ultimately. How minimalist do you want to be? ... Pidgin for me lets me do everything I want to do without a lot of flash. I don't want to be able to play games over it, or send picture (though pidgin does this), or send neat little animated emoticons or nudges. I just want to type messages to my friends and perhaps change my font color from time to time. Some people like pidgin better. This is really true and I wonder why babycheeses is so taken aback by it. I'm not calling live messenger wrong here -- use whatever you want.

I'm not going to pretend that you know that the US dollar is the *de facto* world currency anymore, because you've clearly demonstrated you do not understand this basic fact of international finance. Nearly all countries hold or use dollars, even countries like North Korea that the US does not like, because it is the most useful money in use in 2010. newlinechar  newlinechar The only bank accounts the Fed can control are bank accounts in the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason why it's beyond you that US dollars people hold are their property is again because you lack the fundamental financial and accounting knowledge to be allowed outside /r/politics without an escort.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just look at what happens when a person puts money in a bank: the bank creates an asset (cash) and a liability (the deposit). The reason why it's a liability is because the money is not the bank's property; the bank has a duty to repay you back in dollars.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only way the Federal Reserve (or any other organization) could take money away from you without your consent is to deprive you of your right to that money. They have violated your property rights.  newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind, money existed before governments because people desire having a fungible, divisible, transportable medium of exchange. The reason why governments issue money (and then central banks usurp that power) is because with the monopoly power over the money supply, they have control over the actions of people. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;that 'something' happen to belong to the parent. newlinechar  newlinechar If the 1st parent doesn't know what the thing is they are looking for in the 2nd parent's house, how can they pretend to own it?

I'm not talking about refusing to accept that they *exist*, I'm talking about refusing to accept that nothing can be done to contain them. newlinechar  newlinechar And as for your magical scenario where the rich are super-rich *and* the poor are still well-off, the problem is, that scenario doesn't really play out. Ever since Reagan took office and enacted all kinds of give-aways to the rich, their share of the wealth in America [has been steadily growing](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2009-08-11-Saez_Inequality_Chart_2.jpg), which would be all well and good if the average family saw their wealth increase too. However, it was around that same time [the GDP left the average American family in the dust](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_H6XW_a4TYus/SeY2m-D-HLI/AAAAAAAAAmw/DwcmhRr0uZU/s400/inequality+graph.png), with [the rich getting richer and the poor more or less staying right where they are](http://contexts.org/socimages/files/blogger2wp/Class-RisingInequality.png), and hey, that's all well and good for the rich folks, and I don't argue that their earnings should stay at 1980s levels if everyone else's does too. Rather, I don't think it's too much to ask that, since they're really the only ones to have benefited in the last *three decades*, that they give back a portion of that to allow everyone else to benefit as well. It's also worth noting that our nation's greatest economic crises, the Great Depression, and our current recession, both occurred at *major* spikes in wealth disparity. In other words, that shit *ain't* healthy for our economy. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, I certainly wouldn't argue against *everyone* being successful, but every argument along the lines that you're making has *not* succeeded to that end - it has only benefited the wealthy and done *nothing* for the poor. As such, I think it's only natural for me to be wary of someone making that same argument. In theory, it's quite reasonable, but in practice the poor almost always end up getting shafted while the rich get ahead.
It's okay - there's a perfect forth between A440 and the E below it so you can actually tune either. newlinechar  newlinechar You might also tune to the buzz tone (the other interfering 350Hz tone) to E, though it's a little bit higher than the standard E would be, which will just make you sound slightly tinnier. newlinechar  newlinechar Fun fact: the Berlin Philharmonic used to tune to A435 and a major Tokyo Orchestra used to tune to A448. The differences in tone, which you almost cannot hear, gave the Tokyo orchestra a tinny sound and the Berlin Philharmonic the typical Germanic Big Boomy Sound.

&gt;First, slavery was an integral part of the American economy during the slave trade. I’ve read some papers that go so far as to say the American economy was built off of the slave trade. It appears the American version of history is a little different then the version they teach in Canada. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course slavery was an big part of our agriculture.  But what do you think happened to poor white farmers when free labor was available to the rich?  Do you think that small/mid-sized family farms could compete with the wealthy?  Or do you have the mistaken belief that all southerners owned slaves? newlinechar  newlinechar Slavery did not exist inside of a bubble, it had many repercussions on the poor whites (especially Southern).  They were not able to compete with the big farms, leaving wealth to accumulate with a select few and they were not able to find high paying jobs. newlinechar  newlinechar Look up Appalachian poverty if you don't believe me.  The southern white person is amongst the poorest in our country. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My point is that there are far less poor white people then poor African Americans newlinechar  newlinechar No, there are more poor white people than poor African Americans.  Black people make up a small portion of our population (around 15% I believe), so statistically, there will be less poor black people than poor white people.  But they (within their own community) have a higher percentage of poor than white people do. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I have also witnessed some disgusting, racist acts that 'Billy Bob' doesn't have to worry about. Maybe its different in Canada but ive never experienced or seen the discrimination against rural people you talk about. newlinechar  newlinechar I beg to differ, class warfare is/has been/and always will be more vicious than racism.  Especially since it is not open like racism can be.

Calling it abnormal implies that it's uncommon, and I can assure you that gay people are pretty common. newlinechar  newlinechar It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy, because if you act like it's weird or 'abnormal' and decide to immediately label anything gay as gross, you make it seem a lot more weird and abnormal than it actually is. So it's okay to broadcast heterosexuality instead because you're heterosexual? So if this was a commercial about a straight dating website and one of the dudes was a chick it would be completely different? Honestly? Fuck you.

Destroying a book might be freedom of expression, but you're essentially engaged in your own personal censorship. If you really want to go down that path, there are a lot more Christians with a lot more resources than Atheists. If an Atheist movement went to the trouble to get copies of the God Delusion in Hotel Rooms, and Christians decided to adopt your tactic, and censor you by destroying them, they'd win out. newlinechar  newlinechar You're really no different than a Christian who says 'Silence people I don't agree with!

&gt; I find this solution woefully inadequate. newlinechar  newlinechar Please do not take this the wrong way, but I am having trouble figuring out how it might be possible to implement Taladar's idea about merging discussion threads without the approach becoming prohibitively complex.  My specific issue is this: how do you merge discussion threads?  Thinking it through, a number of questions occur to me that seem hard to answer. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, who gets to decide that two threads refer to the same topic?  After two threads are merged, wouldn't it be confusing to users to read comments that refer to the first thread, when the user expectes to see comments referring specifically to the second thread?  Would both of the original posts that spawned the threads before the merge be preserved, or would one be eliminated?  If both are preserved, how are they presented to the readers of the conversation thread?  And what happens if two different threads get merged that shouldn't be merged?  When treads get split, which comments go with which thread?   newlinechar  newlinechar And what is wrong with having different discussions over the same issues?  For instance, in reddit, double-posts are frequent, and each post retains its own discussion thread; is this problematic, in your view?  If it proves very difficult to implement this idea without the solution being complicated, is this feature so important that a complicated solution be accepted? newlinechar

I am not an aggressive marketer and don't believe I need to become an asshole just to compete, but I can't just sit back and wait for things to come to me either.   newlinechar  newlinechar I hate having to wait for sites to load and god forbid people put any music on there.

Some of them cost U$1K, which I'm not going to fork over, but I figure I should be able to learn how to modify themes etc.  I'll check out Pixelpost and Cheesecake, thanks!  My portfolio that I have on my subdomain is really old (built in 2008) and I've shot a ton of stuff since then.

I figure dolphins and their ancestors have been reasonably intelligent for the last 50 million years.  I mean, 50 million years ago, they were hooved carnivores that used sonar to hunt fish in rivers.  From there they evolved into river dolphins, and from there into ocean-dwelling dolphins and whales, as well as blind river dolphins in the Amazon, the Ganges, and the Yangtzee.  They've had decent sized brains most of that time.  I find that utterly mind-blowing.  It's like they're directing their own evolution by choosing truly superior methods of survival.  If you live like that, who needs opposable thumbs?

I think the community standards would be the single largest factor in the success or failure of something like this.

&gt; anything anyone does has some sentiment of selfishness. So to say suicide is selfish isn't different than saying wanting the person considering suicide to live through the pain ,agony that is their life is pretty selfish. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree, and for the record that is in effect what I was saying.    The complementary argument is not for the family and friends to intervene selfishly, but rather for them to *understand that the person was in pain* and wanted nothing more than to end their own life.  There will always be some residual anger when someone you love takes their own life.  The important thing to leave behind you is the knowledge that you were in your right mind and that you wanted to save yourself and them the pain of what you were going through or were about to go through.  Accepting that is always hard for those left behind.   But I feel strongly that suicide is a private matter.  If you lack the conviction to commit suicide, you probably shouldn't; it is far too easy to pawn it off on someone else, shifting the blame and acceptance off to them.   newlinechar  newlinechar NOTE:  I'm not saying that there aren't circumstances through paraplegia or a lack of living will that someone may wish but be physically unable to commit suicide. **But please do not confuse suicide with euthanasia.**

Banning household pets is not a legitimate cause.   newlinechar  newlinechar Since people never want to believe this, before you downvote actually look into their own website.

That leaves 10 - 14 years before all pets disappear.   newlinechar  newlinechar They do not believe in animal ownership of any kind.  They simply tolerate well cared for pets to be kept alive until they die naturally.  This results in the goal of total 'animal freedom'.

People that commit suicide do it because they are not satisfied with living anymore. Same thing can be said of euthanasia, doing so stops a persons suffering and those that commit suicide are indeed suffering a great deal. And if I lost a limb I would seriously consider suicide as well, sure you could say 'but you have so much to live for' where I say 'well I'll be dead so what will I care, I don't want to deal with the struggle and disadvantage of being impaired'. You might have a problem with suicide and you might want to live out a natural life but it is cruel to take away that choice from someone else. After all we all die anyway so what does it matter when and how we do it?

I'm just too pragmatic to even be able to even try to listen to bullshit.  It's not that I don't want *relationships* with unavailable women, it's that I don't want to waste my time in pursuit of a romantic relationship based on bullshit words and games, especially involving other people.  People are complex enough without that shit. A relationship should be based around your emotional compatibility with a person and helping each other everyday.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I consider emotional support a service that I offer and it frankly is quite strenuous for me as I'm actually very empathetic.  If this girl was actually in stress I would have not responded like I did.  It was more like gossip or some social game I don't care for. I simply don't have the energy to try to care for someone's problems only to figure out that there just talking to talk. When someone approaches me with a problem I do the guy thing and try to fix it. If they are sad then I'll try to make them feel better.  If you want a debate or conversation great, but I'm not going to talk about other people behind their backs and I'm not going to stand there and listen to you talk about your problems and stroke your ego.  It's a waste both our time because I simply lack the ability to fake interest. In all my experience this has always been the best policy for everyone involved.    newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, this does limit my potential number of relationships but I'm more into quality relationships.  Besides, I can't stand that shit so there would be no point in pursuing a relationship with that kind of person.  Maybe she did want me but I tried the shallow relationship once and it just doesn't work for me.  I can't fake it and both of us end up hurting and unhappy eventually.

They aren't necessarily 'against' your side, either, because that's a terrible construction of the debate. I see this to be a problem coming from equivocation over what philosophy refers to; a branch of academic criticism, fashionable social criticism, grad students posting on the internet, or whatever else. Somehow, someone got it in their head that the debate over science is a political struggle between scientists and 'anti-scientists' (creationist, or whoever). This is false, the debate over science is a *philosophical* one and has existed before the age of enlightenment.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, yes, I graduated with a degree in Philosophy but I'm an ardent neo-humean.

In reality, forcing users to add a few extra characters to their passwords, and relaxing constraints on w4cky characters will make your system more secure anyway.  Forcing users to use non alphanumeric characters or mandating a mix of upper &amp; lowercase, as opposed to just even just simple an all-lowercase alphabet doesn't gain you much.  For example, an 8 character password that mandates mixed case and a few non-alphanumeric characters can have no more than 94^8 = 6.10E+15 combinations (in reality, a lot less, since that includes passwords that are all lowercase, contain no special characters, etc.).  However, the same number of permutations can be exceeded by a case-insensitive alpha-only password with just 12 characters (26^12 = 9.54E16). newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, a strictly alpha password would be more vulnerable to a dictionary attack, as users would probably compose it of known words, but just adding the requirement of 2 or more numbers in the middle would fix that problem, and would be way easier for users to remember than the obnoxious keyboard smash that many systems trying for maximum security force on their users.
Not wasted, really. Just neutralized.

That was a powerful moment and really made me question Janeway's decision.

From our discussion in the past, as well as some of your recent comments, you seem really hung up on CO2 forcing.  May I offer some food for thought. newlinechar  newlinechar - Insolation is typically around 1,400 W/m^2, meaning forcing from CO2 is around one-tenth of one-percent of average insolation, and well within natural solar variation. newlinechar  newlinechar - Radiative forcing from CO2 is non-linear.  The forcing from the first 10% increase in CO2 will be greater than the forcing from the second 10% increase, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar - Recent peer-reviewed literature (Lindzen and Choi) suggest that forcing is actually less than 1.6 W/m^2, by about a factor of 6. newlinechar  newlinechar - To cite a radiative forcing neglects feedbacks.  Ancient proxies suggest major negative feedbacks when the temperature rises.

Something to do with dogs I believe.
&gt;You aren't spreading your own ideas by destroying Bibles newlinechar  newlinechar Agreed.  But I contend that I *am* spreading my own ideas if I alter bibles and offer that product to the masses in order to make a statement (which is why I posted the original thread).  And again, I'm only altering books that are mine (assuming the Gideons make good on their word that I'm free to take them).  I would never advocate taking someone else's book, let alone taking it and destroying it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would much rather have a Bible next to 'The God Delusion' in a drawer than no books at all and a bonfire in the front yard.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would much rather have nothing at all in a drawer and *no* bonfire in the front yard.  Why should there be bibles in hotel rooms in the first place?  I understand that hotel chains are private enterprises and that they're free to do what they want, but it's generally accepted that bibles should always be found in bedside drawers in hotel rooms.  Why?  People would make quite a fuss if bibles weren't there, or, alternately if there *were* copies of *The God Delusion* and the bible in their room, like you suggested.  Can you imagine the reaction if a Marriott only placed copies of the Koran in their rooms?  The truth is, major corporations probably shouldn't endorse any belief system, and if they do, they should be prepared for any backlash.  The fact that hotels don't claim those bibles as their property is testament to their desire to distance themselves from the issue.  If they were running a library, they would be much more concerned with keeping track of their books and ensuring their return.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're really no different than a Christian who says 'Silence people I don't agree with!...' newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree, and I believe there's a fundamental difference.  I am *not* advocating the destruction of the bible or the Christian message.  I am, however, advocating that people treat it no differently than any other information they receive.  I don't expect to find copies of Newton's *Pricipia* in hotels, despite the fact that people could benefit from reading it and that much of it is in line with my ideas.  And I don't think people should be prevented from doing what they want with their own copies of *Pricipia* as long as those copies aren't of historical significance.

Oh god that is just horrifying.
&gt; if you're going to understand the last two millennia of history, culture, and art in Europe, you're going to need the Bible... newlinechar  newlinechar This is nonsense because most people don't know anything about the 'Bible' anyway. People would get far more out of a good history or art book written by scholars who may *reference* the 'Bible' (a story or 2 perhaps at the most). newlinechar  newlinechar Any deep, nuanced understanding (if that's possible on the subject) is the bullshit of scholars and is not really all that helpful. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It would be like trying to understand English literature without Shakespeare or contemporary biology without On the Origin of Species. newlinechar  newlinechar The same goes here. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be a loss if no one knew the history by which the theory of evolution was constructed, but who really cares... that's just small stuff. newlinechar  newlinechar Who really cares if Shakespeare coined some oft-used English phrases. It's interesting, but doesn't really matter. Literature is only really important to its contemporary audience; beyond that, it's just the bullshit of scholars. Shakespeare is of pretty much no use today (I say that with a straight face).

&gt;Please do not take this the wrong way, newlinechar  newlinechar Not at all, these are all valid concerns.  I agree that merging/splitting threads would be a terribly difficult issue.  I also agree that multiple discussions over the same issues are not necessarily bad things. newlinechar  newlinechar I think my primary concern is one of efficiency: if I come to the website to discuss Issue X, I don't want to have to comb through 100 threads, each with 1000 posts, before I can make a contribution.  Furthermore, if I'm in the midst of a discussion I don't want newcomers to keep asking the same questions or making the same previously-rebutted points over and over again (which they surely would, not having read the previous 100 threads).  Maybe at the most basic level what I'm after is a continually-updated summary. newlinechar  newlinechar Much more modest proposal: have a sort of 'discussion wiki' that tracks the evolution of forum discussions on major issues.  Each issue would have one page on the wiki that would summarize key points and facts made in the forum.  The page would have a hierarchical structure, so that a casual observer could quickly understand the flow of the main points under discussion and then drill down to a finer level of granularity.  The wiki page would, where appropriate, cite both external sources and particular sections of APP forum threads.  I imagine that with such a system in place, we could have lengthy debates/discussions in the forums that culminate in a very small number of new insights/opinions.  The small, but valuable, fruits of this discussion would then be added to the wiki for the benefit of all. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, community standards and participation would be vital to the functioning of such a system.  I'm not too familiar with how Wikipedia deals with these issues, but I will try to learn more. newlinechar  newlinechar Please feel free to tell me if these ideas are more 'pie in the sky' than you're looking for right now; I would certainly understand :).

ah, more like you only have very elementary understanding of finance without knowing the fine details. NK can use dollar to trade by holding an dollar denominated account in a bank within U.S. which come under supervision of the Fed. When dollar is traded in London or elsewhere, they do it through clearing mechanism of dollar denominated bank accounts, which must have be held by a bank supervised by the Fed.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even countries like NK or Soviet are/were allowed to use dollar because it served U.S. interest, the most notable one being that U.S can run deficit (to borrow money) in its own currency. newlinechar  newlinechar When a person put money denominated in dollar in a bank, that person is transferring fund from one bank to another including the case where he use bank note. When you hold bank notes, technically, you are holding a claim in the Fed. When you deposit bank notes in the Citi bank, you are technically, transferring your account from the central bank to Citi Bank. newlinechar  newlinechar If the central bank want to freeze NK's dollar denominated bank account, or NK bank which operate dollar, it will simply freeze the account this bank hold in the Fed or (more likely) it will tell the bank which hold NK account to freeze the account. Such bank must oblige because failure to do so will ultimately result in that bank being locked out from the dollar banking system.  newlinechar  newlinechar The central bank has legal monopoly over the validation of legal tender including the bank account denominated in a currency the central bank control. Money exist in coin before the government but the central banking system based on clearing system only existed after the government.  newlinechar  newlinechar You cannot open a dollar account which does not come under the jurisdiction of Fed. If you are a bank in London who accept dollar denominated account, then you must hold a balance either  directly in the Fed or in a bank which does so.

It's the same with all foreign languages. A friend of mine used to joke with me that the reason my German improved while drunk was that German is designed to be spoken drunk. Then we noticed that it happens with all foreign languages. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is, you're not actually getting better; you're just not as careful. You don't stop and look for the right words or stick to the perfect syntax you were taught. This means less pauses, more fluidity. You'll make mistakes, but you won't notice them as often (or care about them as much when you do), and people will still understand what you're trying to say.

So you don't think it's of any value to recognize that West Side Story is basically a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, and The Lion King a retelling of Hamlet?  That 'The Island/Come And See' by The Decemberists is a poetic reinterpretation of The Tempest? newlinechar  newlinechar In all cultural domains, but particularly in art, ideas build upon each other.  No art exists in a vacuum.  And if you lose what a particular cultural artifact is built on top of, you lose a lot of the context necessary to truly understand it. newlinechar  newlinechar Shakespeare and the Bible are like the fossil record, but in memetics rather than genetics.  With the Bible, you have two thousand years of the history of pretty much an entire continent being dominated by variations on a single theme; if you have a missing link in the fossil chain, it becomes much more difficult to piece that all those memes together into the larger picture.

I liked the idea that a 'good', if socially inadequate person, who was entirely focussed on the 'puzzle', almost as a form of (over)compensation could develop a social conscience and start to care about his subjects, and that, in turn, could start to heal his social inadequacy.

Thanks for the AMA. Giving preferential treatment to women is very common in mixed gender establishments. For example bars and saunas, which try in various ways to keep out or limit unpaired men, or charge them much higher entry fees. Personally I disagree with it, but then I'm neither a woman, nor someone attracted to women, so I get no benefit from the reduced hassle or the higher cunt to dick ratio. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to point out that what is really disciminatory is the claim that keeping out single men is for the *safety* of others. Being hooked up with a woman does not make a man safe, and unattached males are not by definition creepy dangerous people.  These kinds of policies have more to do with maintaining a balance in the genders, as women are very sensitive to the male gaze, which they often inaccurately report as creepy because the female mind has the sex circuit crossed with the centipedes are crawlng into my vagina!

I do have issues creating non-romantic relationships with most girls.  I like to think that it's more them then me.  There are two girls I'm attracted to that I have a non-romantic relationship with and I'm pretty sure the only reason that is possible is they are mature and level headed.  If a girl who's in a relationship with someone and/or just cannot figure out who they are attracted to, causing self-centered drama bullshit, it just rubs me the wrong way and I cannot continue talking to that person.  It comes off as rude and they don't talk to me anymore either and it saves us both undue stress.   newlinechar  newlinechar We are not peacocks and we're not pack animals so I don't care for strutting or threat displays by either sex.

If they didn't stop the bad guys, they were all in danger of dying (which they did anyway), and when you get to the 'we're all going to die' point, you have many more options available since you don't have a choice in the risk level you're involved in at that point. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; but it seems more like people don't want to help anyone unless it directly affects themselves newlinechar  newlinechar True, and as I said, I think that's sad and I hope we can get more heros out there. newlinechar  newlinechar But 'obligation' is about minimum required action... and risking your life is not a general obligation. newlinechar  newlinechar It's great, it's a sad thing more people don't respond for one reason or another... but I don't see it as a general obligation.

...or, we can just recognize that welfare takes money that otherwise would go to charity (and, therefore, people who are actually *interested in* helping people and *good at it*, which is far more than anyone can say of *any* government) and it provably harms some segments of the population. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We don't live in Charles Dickens' *A Christmas Carol*.  There are more charities out there than one can shake a stick at.  They're motivated, and they're effective, and people will stop funding one if they find out that fraud is going on within the charity.  You can't stop funding the federal govt. when you find out fraud is going on within it or when people are defrauding the system.  Also given that many government workers are virtually impossible to fire and you've got a virtual guarantee that both will occur in significant proportions and that little will be done about it.  That doesn't sound anything like compassion to me.  It sounds like a wasteful trough filled with my tax dollars and yours.

&gt;or do you have the mistaken belief that all southerners owned slaves? newlinechar  newlinechar Certainly not all southerns, slavery was just a big of a problem in the north as the south (ie New England). it was also a big problem in Canada too. Basically, it was a North American problem. Slavery was only banned in the North first because of economic incentives not the moral bullshit some revisionist historians try to pull. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Slavery did not exist inside of a bubble, it had many repercussions on the poor whites  newlinechar  newlinechar i agree.

Our income is a little more evenly distributed because of government redistribution, maybe that has something to do with it. Even with that, i doubt class warfare is worse then the displacement and slavery of 12 million Africans. The only thing related to class warfare that might be worse then that is starvation/murder of 20 million in Bolshevik Russia (but i'm pretty sure that not what your referring to and thats a stretch because there were lots of other issues there). Regardless, thats a little off topic. **Anything 'white only' is still a sensitive issue for those who had to endure the shame of white only buses, white only schools, white only restrooms etc. Victims of class warfare should at least be sympathetic and understanding of these feelings. So maybe focusing on 'rural only' scholarships is bit more tactful (they already exist FYI). They address the class issue without bringing the messy element of race into the equation.** newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Especially since it is not open like racism can be. newlinechar  newlinechar Racism is often very subtle or even sub-conscious. i.e. the increased rate of being pulled over or not getting an interview because of an African sounding name on a resume (an interesting study was done on this. same resume, different name leads to a drastic difference in the # calls for an interview. its sub-conscious racism).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But my main point remains.... **I think its a good idea to provide African Americans with extra financial help in comparison to other groups because of statistics you mentioned.** Whites, as a group, do not need extra financial help. there are a lot of scholarship whites, blues, black, greens and even purples could apply for. I just think that because, as a group, blacks are more disadvantaged its a good idea to provide some extra financial aid specifically for them. Whites, as group, are comparably well off.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: i added some boldness for main points newlinechar  newlinechar

Well to make you feel better, I'll tell you my armadillo story: newlinechar  newlinechar I was visiting Korea with my mom and my 4-year-old brother, who brought a little stuffed armadillo with the Texas flag on it [kinda like this](http://www.greatplacestoyou.com/txrwbarmadillo.html), but grey.  In Korea they've never seen or heard of an armadillo, so they were quite puzzled by it and eventually had the interpreter ask us.  We tried to explain it but it ended up sounding half-mythological.

Why unfortunately?  A sauna I go to has a large gay clientelle who have sex in a specially designated steam room, while cruising around the rest of the place.  I know they have sex there, but this is not 'unfortunate' knowledge.  People like to have sex.    
And if you cloak and decloak in less than the time of a single target from a battleship (which could easily be 15 seconds for some types of rats), they will still be targeting you from the previous round and lock you essentially instantly, ie, being cloaked doesn't interrupt lock in progress, it just cancels a lock that lands while you are cloaked. newlinechar  newlinechar Incidentally, this is true for PVP as well, so be careful.

If they've got a single hash, and the salt made them unable to precalculate anything, that's a win right there. But whether or not they know the salt, brute forcing will take the same amount of time. So the salt makes them use the _worst_ attack algorithm possible, and knowledge of it doesn't improve their odds even in that case.  newlinechar  newlinechar But that's not what's truly great about salts. Say they compromised your entire account database. And instead of trying to crack a single admin account, they're just wanting to break _any_ account. Assuming you generate a different salt for every password hash... they have to re-perform brute force attacks on each entry, they can't parallelize their attack even on the accounts w/in the database; whereas if salts are reused, ever, that makes 2 accounts with a matching salt twice as efficient to brute force. newlinechar  newlinechar Salts are not a secret that has to be protected. Salts are a hedge against homogeny to prevent precalculation, and that it all.
Totally - the only hope I can see in the iPad is that Apple's generally been good about fixing the most egregious problems with its products.

Almost certain you can't bring food or drink into Disney proper, of any location, meaning the place where the rides are located. Would seriously cut into the profit.   I'm sure the resort area is a different story.
Ignore that, there is nothing to gain in Ulduar or less (although if it is a pro group, fast badges are nice...there could be a trinket or two that you want but it's not worth the time). newlinechar  newlinechar To gear up, what you want to do is farm heroics while looking for any ToC, ICC, or VoA raid (10 and 25) that will have you.   This may be hard at first because of your bad gear, but as you get more gear you will get into more raids.   Also make sure to do weekly raid/daily heroic to get as much frost badges as possible. newlinechar  newlinechar For badges 4p t9 (I'm not sure which ones for rogue, although I know the hat and chest are 2 of them), 245 ring, and maybe the hit/ap trinket (the haste one is for casters).  Make sure to keep farming the 3 ICC 5 mans till you get every off-piece you can get.   Save your frost badges for something awesome.   I'm not sure how good your t10 is, I don't think it's that great (maybe 2p is good though, t9 4p is very good as far as I remember).   The frost badge trinket is really good, so that might be a good first choice.   Also try to farm or raid ICC to get at least your 251 rep ring...it's free, best in slow at the highest level, and it only takes 1/2 partial runs of ICC 10 to get (or an hour or two of rep grind). newlinechar  newlinechar As you get to the max from badges level, getting into pugs should become easier.  Hope for lucky rolls or join a guild....That's about it. newlinechar  newlinechar Try to avoid fail runs if you can.  As you get more experience with pugging you should be able to tell quickly if people have no idea what they are doing (is there a vent, are the tanks poorly geared, how good the DPS is on the trash pulls/first boss wipe, what caused a wipe (ie bad luck ie all the tank healers got bone spiked or did everyone stand in a fire and die, ect).   Getting saved to a fail run is the worst thing that can happen, so be ready to bail if it's looking bad.   Do, however, consider that if you are the only leather wearer in raid you will prob have dibs on your drops..so sometimes sticking out a fail group is worth it.  Lastly, watch for ninjas, they suck. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now about your class/gear.   Do realize that combat is a lower DPS spec then mutilate...you might want to go mut to get better DPS in pugs.   Know that there is a crit cap that is easily reached in ToC+ gear.  Once you hit it, gem Attack Power.   Also, if you are combat, once you get enough armor pen gear start gemming for arp.  Don't worry about arp till you have 800 or so from gear. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That was a bit much...but I think it's good advice.

You are missing the point.  Jurisdiction is pointless here.  It has nothing to do with anything. newlinechar  newlinechar The US says, give back the money or you lose the right to be a bank in the US.  Something the US has the right to do. newlinechar  newlinechar UBS can tell the US that due to swiss law we cannot give the money back.  If that is true, too bad for UBS.  They won't be a bank in the US anymore.  If they fail, oh well.  Tough luck. newlinechar  newlinechar One thing is for sure.  If UBS falls over this, no other bank is every going to transfer illegal money out of the US again.  It won't be worth it.  And that is why the US needs to let UBS fall.  Make an example. newlinechar  newlinechar Remember this isn't a case of UBS being used by US people to hide their money without UBS knowing about it.  UBS basically offered the service to get money out and advertised it to rich people.  Supposedly UBS employees even carried money personally in suitcases back to switzerland.  They knew it was a crime.

Sure. My experience is only in Maine. - But, it can be easy (especially at night) to run over a lobster pot and get your propeller snagged in a buoy. -Or even a rudder or keel if you're in a sailboat. Often times it's possible to untangle, but sometimes it's not, so you pull a knife out, cut the buoy loose and go on your way. newlinechar  newlinechar But, that means a lobsterman is going to loose his lobster pot, and whatever lobsters were in it. It's very much frowned upon, like dinging a parked car and riding off. -And that's just when you're benevolent.

Well, they figure that if you get caught once, there are 10 other times when you did it before. Not the best precedent, but lobstering is very important to the local economy, and the law looks after people's livelihoods.

Late reply indeed. I had never heard of the first-person omniscient style. The book I saw mentioned is post-modern apparently? I don't read tons of modern literature, so that sort of thing might fly right over me I suppose. Don't worry about alienating somebody like me, I'm probably not your audience per se. I mean, I'd certainly be interested in reading something you wrote, but I'm probably not the sort of person you'd market towards. I imagine that I would get used to the narration style, it just came across as lazy to me, because I didn't realize it was an intentional style choice. Like I said, it seemed like a traditional narration style until that point.

I agree with the point that for some suicidal feelings are not necessarily untreatable and I am not saying that suicide or euthanasia should be taken lightly. Counseling should be provided and families should be consulted, but ultimately it should still be the choice of the individual in question.

However, I also understand that any COMPONENT of the weapon made after that date can make the weapon illegal, i.e. a firing motor added to a crank gun.  I can't see the label on the weapon, but I would be willing to bet that weapon isn't 25 years old.

&gt;So why aren't there more escape attempts? newlinechar  newlinechar The reality is that it is extremely difficult to escape from a high security prison. It takes not only planning and accumulation of supplies, but also the cooperation of every other inmate in your housing unit. It only takes one snitch to kill a plot. The inmate I shot had to get a piece of a hacksaw blade, climb to the top of the recreation cage when no one was watching (rare) and cut 12-15 chain links. Then he had to climb on to the roof, run to the end, drop 40 feet to the ground, climb 2 fences topped with razor wire, dodge gunfire, and run 3 miles to be off prison property. He ran all 7 miles to harmon creek with a bullet wound to the back and a broken femur. He was highly motivated, but the obstacles beat him.  newlinechar  newlinechar On top of that deathrow inmates usually live 20-30 years in prison before execution. they get used to living in prison and fear death like anyone.

One of my good friends is a doc in a hospital. He's told me that people are trying to die all the time, but that the family will fight to keep them alive, at the cost of incredible suffering, because they are unable to let go.   newlinechar  newlinechar He actually uses that phrase now when talking to families whose loved ones are dying:   newlinechar  newlinechar *'Your husband is trying to die.'*    newlinechar  newlinechar He's told me that he frequently performs chest compressions on elderly patients that are terminally ill / coding, and can feel and hear their ribs breaking from the force. All because the family insists on **doing everything possible** to keep them alive.   newlinechar  newlinechar He's also made me promise to kill him in his sleep if he ever gets terminal cancer. He wasn't kidding.

I had a theatre teacher who was amazing, just slightly uptight about how you should follow school policy, whether you agree or not, but she was an amazing teacher. And the classes hated her, except for the drama/improv club, and the advanced theatre class.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They would constantly make her cry day in, and day out. She couldn't control them, because they just wouldn't pay attention, even when she tried to be strict.  newlinechar  newlinechar The last day of school she was in tears, and all the students were cursing her out, and telling her they're glad she was leaving. She left the district. When she did, the theatre, theatre club, one act play, and improv club all simultaneously died.  newlinechar  newlinechar The teacher that took over neither cared to really do them, nor did she attempt.  newlinechar  newlinechar The previous teacher had organized tons of plays and a musical, the one act play, and a talent show and an improv show, and a trip to a renaissance fair that year. And she was chased out of the school, because she had ungrateful students who either were forced to take her speech class, or had to take her standard theatre class for an arts credit, didn't like it, and therefore took it out on her.  newlinechar  newlinechar Our entire school went this way for the 3 years I remained at that school. Good teachers would say 'I'm not dealing with this' and leave, and we'd get new, less-than-adequate teachers who only got the job because the good ones with a few shortcomings left. newlinechar  newlinechar My point here is, while some teachers are assholes, or can't handle their classes perfectly, you shouldn't be rude to them. Alot of what you see really is more of you and your fellow students and the teachers combined, butting heads, rather than just the teachers. newlinechar  newlinechar When you get out of school, you realize a lot of them weren't as shitty as they seemed. Try to treat them better and pay attention. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, what you said just annoyed me. It sounded like you were saying 'The teacher couldn't handle us, so we did anything we wanted.' Not meaning to be rude or anything, it just really sounded shitty.
Bingo.  Some of us will accept steps toward our utopia rather than wait for utopia to be formed.  We feel that each step towards individual control (federal -&gt; state -&gt; county -&gt; town -&gt; neighborhood -&gt; person) is a step in the right direction... even if it's not the ultimate goal.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Ron Paul rightly sees that a presentation of utopia wouldn't be understood by the masses... so we have to take gradual steps.  You still have to be a politician to be in politics... some here don't like that, but it's reality.

It's a lot easier to find details like that because neanderthals lived in caves, whereas H. sapiens of the time only did so in some areas. Neanderthals tended toward lowland caves, whereas sapiens often camped on hilltops. This gave an advantage in hunting, as it allows for a better view of the landscape. Moreover, sapiens developed the bow. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, the supposedly less violent neanderthals had very sophisticated spear tip technology--better than that of contemporary sapiens. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I don't doubt that sapiens were vicious little bastards to the neanderthals. I simply doubt that neanderthals held the monopoly on good will and art. Cave sites just make for better preservation of such things, which is why we don't hear as much about sapiens cultures of the time.

&gt;doomed Uranium based R&amp;D newlinechar  newlinechar How is it doomed?  newlinechar  newlinechar We're going to be using any reactors built now for 60+ years, and uranium reactors are likely to comprise the majority of new reactors for at least the next 30, so the payoff for research into the fuel cycle that will dominate the rest of this century yields huge dividends in a relatively short timespan. newlinechar  newlinechar _Any_ nuclear research is important, especially any research into breeders (whether fast or thermal).  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd prefer that a LFTR design were commercialized and construction started, but I'd settle for an IFR since it's probably closer to commercialization (the GE Prism design).
National growth does not occur from cost cutting. We've had 8 years of it. Some people may choose to retire.

Then, we need process engineers.  What if our future were furniture design?  Then we'd need designers.  What if it were nuclear and solar power?  Then we'd need electrical and mechanical engineers.  What's not to like? newlinechar  newlinechar There is an issue today and it is lack of growth.  That issue is - unless we stop trying to arrive at increased profits only by cutting costs we won't have national growth.  Think about it.  If I cut cost, and you cut cost, and every producer does, all we have done is to shrink the economy. To change this, the corporate CFO has to see a more optimal bottom line reflected by growth. newlinechar  newlinechar What does that take?  It takes having a greater reward for reinvesting in your corporate growth and a lesser reward for declaring immediate profit.  This means delaying profit in favor of corporate strength and growth and sustainability and the added investment required must also appear to be more attractive and a wise choice to the stockholder.   newlinechar  newlinechar Making this happen at a national level is done with policy instruments.  Other countries are able to attract investment.  Otherwise, we would not be experiencing such competition.  We need to change our policies to encourage growth instead of asking corporate CFOs to constantly 'save cost.'

That is what i consider one of my biggest problems, depression immobilizes me. I have literally no motivation to do anything. Im not saying making new friends has worked for me, because honestly i haven't tried, but from my perspective, getting to know new people that i can actually relate with would make me very happy. Then again, i don't know how long that would last, maybe just the act of someone new liking me would make me happy, I don't know. It could be a loop of depression and the newness of people temporarily makes me happy. newlinechar  newlinechar I know how you feel though, especially with going to college, i get to meet a lot of new people but they all feel so familiar.

I think you've got it the wrong way round. When the phrase was originally penned, 'fittest' was the appropriate term to use, but was then mis-interpreted by non-scientists to mean 'most athletic'. It was meant by Darwin to mean survival of that which fits best into its environment.
Yes I see where you were getting at now.  newlinechar  newlinechar  What I was trying to say is that death is very hard to reach. That is why people would ask for help. Your body is very adapt at surviving. I don't think its a lack of convicition when your afraid its gonna fail. Many suicides fail, there aint really numbers to throw out but theres an estimated 20-30 million suicide attempts every year, a good percentage of them fail with lasting effects. So that is why asking for help, should be the same as asking for help to deal with an addiction.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also I don't think I'm confusing suicide with euthanasia, Terry Pratchett is going to be the one whos gonna have to give the pills to himself. And with most physician assisted-suicides the doctor aint the one pulling the cord its patient. Which is what this law allows. It's suicide by the very definition of suicide, the only assistance is the doctor prescribing the items.

Because he is making agnosticism (which is about knowledge, not belief) and atheism (which is about belief, not knowledge) into exclusive categories (which they aren't), as a result making the definition of atheism almost useless when talking about what people actually believe (hardly any atheists match his definition).  newlinechar  newlinechar He's aiding a common straw man tactic of theists, who define atheism in this way in order to call atheism a religion. (McGinn isn't making this mistake, but definiing it this way will still be used with glee by certain theists) newlinechar  newlinechar I'm very happy for him in his strong-form atheism, but the word 'atheism' is very simple: newlinechar  newlinechar theism = belief in god(s) newlinechar  newlinechar a-theism = not-theism   (i.e. not having belief in gods) newlinechar  newlinechar -- strong (McGinn style) atheism is having clear belief that there are *no-gods*. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not necessary to redefine 'atheism' to the strong form (active belief in absence of gods), and declare the majority of people who call themselves atheists (but aren't quite as strong about it as that) as non-atheists. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree with making this restricted form 'the' definition of atheism.

That's warmer, but he still doesn't say chattel slavery on a State level is Constitutional. I will admit that, if he did think State level slavery was Constitutional, he might defend it. Paul commonly prioritizes the Constitution over libertarianism. That does not make the libertarian position pro-State rights as something to defend for its own sake.

Even if you assume the Bibles are okay for you to take, you're still practicing censorship because you are motivated whether you admit it or not to prevent someone from reading the Bible. You're targeting Bibles specifically because you don't like the information inside. You could easily just take free travel brochures and alter them to convey your ideas, burn in your fireplace for warmth, or find some other book to alter and convey your ideas. And you've already collected a stack, and declared it will grow, even though you likely have way more than you'll ever end up doing anything with. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not against altering books for some other purpose. The Library at my College used to give away old books, and I made a hollow book out of one. But you are targeting Bibles. What I'm against is destroying, or at the very least, depriving others of books because you don't agree with the content. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't say I don't wish that corporations and businesses wouldn't adopt political or religious agendas I don't agree with, but if I were a business owner, I wouldn't want to have my freedom of speech infringed upon if I wanted to put an Atheist book in my hotel, or an Atheist brochure in the lobby. Nor would I want someone taking copies simply because they don't agree with them. The reason we have Bibles in Hotel rooms, is that every citizen has the right to free speech, even business owners and they have the right to put them in their hotels. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to be a scary conservative Christian myself, and my former self would likely have agreed with you that the book is just paper, but I would have asserted the information inside is still true, not matter what you do to it. You are convincing no one that the information in the Bible isn't true by destroying copies of it. And you are unlikely to convince me you don't advocate the destruction of Bibles when you do it yourself, and come to an atheist forum to ask for ideas with what do with all the ones you've taken from hotel rooms, depriving others of them.

Oh I fully agree, we were, well, behaving like teenagers. Not trying to pretend we were anything but brats.

I don't think 'government is wrong' is the right way to characterize a libertarian society. Libertarian society isn't characterized by the absence of government. It is characterized by the absence of coercive force.   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar The Declaration of Independence gives a nice summary of the correct purpose of government. Governments exist to protect people's rights. So, any organization whose actions are congruent with this goal is a properly functioning government. Libertarian governments pursue this goal while also following the zero aggression principle (or whatever your favorite equivalent formulation is).   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar I don't think libertarians of any stripe would object to the existence of a 'government' that operated in this way. Even anarchists should be satisfied by this as they are not subject to these governments unless they explicitly volunteer to be. Instead they are free to see to the protection of their rights in whatever alternative way seems best to them.   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar It's a mistake to think that a libertarian society would be free of government. On the contrary, I imagine a healthy field of competing governments would arise, all seeking to protect you.

No it's not. The Russians have more practical experience in long term space habitation via their space stations from the 1970's onwards.

Theoretically yes, however the idea is that if everyone is pushing random then it's possible that while you could be set to one side someone else could have pushed random in the time you were waiting and they could have gone to the lopsided side and you really do get a chance to get randomed or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar In long run if everyone pressed random and did it at roughly the same time it'd be pretty random.

&gt; I suppose this is a philosophical issue newlinechar  newlinechar No, it's an epistemological issue.

The causal relationships may be more obscured than those in the bridge-building realm, but I think they're there nonetheless. And if they are there, then mathematics can be applied to them. newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately humans are just electrochemical computers and if you know how every neuron synapses to other neurons, you can predict behaviour accurately. newlinechar  newlinechar But since neuroscience isn't that far along yet and since every individual has a different response to stimulus, the idea that you can mathematically represent human behaviour is absurd. Any attempt to do so will result in a mechanistic model for human action.

Thanks for the link to the article. Very interesting. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My insticts about helmets seem to be backed up by this quote from Julian Bailes, a neurosurgeon, on p6 of the article. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“Helmets are not the answer. The brain has a certain amount of play inside the skull. It’s buoyed up in the cerebral spinal fluid. It sits in this fluid, floats. When the head suddenly stops, the brain continues, reverberates back. So when I hit, boom, my skull stops, but my brain continues forward for about a centimeter. Boom, boom, it reverberates back. So you could have padding that’s a foot thick. It’s not going to change the acceleration/deceleration phenomenon. And a lot of these injuries are rotational. The fibers get torn with rotation. You’ve got a face mask that’s like a fulcrum sitting out here: You get hit, your head swings around. That’s when a lot of these fibers are sheared—by rotation. A helmet can’t ever prevent that. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“And have you seen helmets lately? In the old days of football, you had this leather cap to protect your ears. That was it. You’d never put your head in the game. You’d be knocked out after the first play! Even in the ’60s, the helmet was a light shell. The modern helmet is like a weapon.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Rugby head protectors are like old time football caps. They are just a small amount of foam (with lots of air gaps for heat control) which I think are mostly to prevent the forwards from getting cauliflower ears in the scrum. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Really, football is going to have to change. You can't have a sport (particularly one which children play) the playing of which necessitates long term brain injury leading leading to the early death of its participants. It is natural for people who love their sport to be suspicious of arguments that their sport causes harm. But once the evidence is in, you can't continue to have people profit from this.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“So I told the NFL, I said, ‘Why don’t you take the head out of the game? Just take it out of the game! Let the linemen start from a squatting position instead of getting down for head-to-head. Have them stand up like they do on pass protection. So there’s not this obligatory head contact.’  newlinechar  newlinechar

At the end of MW1, Gaz was shot in the head, leaving him with a terribly scarred face. Presumed dead, he in fact survived. He chose not to reveal his survival to decrease the likelihood of reprisals from the ultranationalists (who blamed Price and his squad for zakhaev's death). newlinechar Instead, he chose a new identity, that of 'Ghost' (geddit? he's dead, but not really dead, so he's a ghost?) and wore this skull mask to cover the scar from the shooting, and also to be intimidating. newlinechar  newlinechar In MW2, Ghost is shot, and then set on fire. However, as before, he survives, and in MW3 is known as 'Phoenix'.
OK, not necessary but much more useful. For example, I have mostly full albums too, and some of them are compilations. Sometimes I might want to listen to a complete compilation, which I can do since they are tagged as such. But at other times I might want to round up every track by a particular artist, including some of the tracks from a compilation. You can't easily do both of these with a directory structure. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no good reason to stick to the old Artist/Album hierarchy of the CD age. Many things aren't necessary, but that doesn't mean they don't make life better.

Well, I can't say personality alone would do it; but I would think it would help a good deal. In the book, Caro would write that LBJ would tell his aides that he would do everything possible to get his way. He would exhaust every possibility, even when he was a congressman. He wouldn't just say, well, this is getting tough, so lets drop our current plans. He would literally do everything. If he couldn't get his way with somebody, he would be on the phone with them constantly; he would meet up with them; he would talk to their friends; he would go to their daughters play. Anything. If you read the books, this was the kind of man he was. He knew about other men's districts their problems. If a senator's family member had a funeral, he would be the only one to show up to pay respects. The Johnson Treatment should be studied.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If there was this attitude, it would help a lot because dems and obama haven't done everything.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar OF course, Obama spent 4 years on the national level before going to president. LBJ had a career spanning decades in congress, both house and the senate.  During his house days, many men absolutely hated LBJ, but they respected him because he would create levers of power for himself. When he got to the senate, he took a different approach and earned the respect of his fellow southerners while trying to play nice with the northerners.  newlinechar  newlinechar Since he was a southerner he could talk to the south about civil rights wheras JFK probably could not. He was a like a uncle confronting a family member about a drinking problem.

No, the background colour is fine. It's properly exposed against white as well (and working with a white background really sucks). Try shooting an orange can instead of blue, it will mean a lot. Maybe the blue one would've looked better on ice, with a bit of context. Orange/red captivate the eye instantly, and it's a lazy way of avoiding building a setup and context for your product. Also there's the brand recognition. Take a Coca-Cola can, place it on a white background and that thing can go on billboards. It doesn't need more context. It would just remind people that 'Hey, we're coca cola. We don't need no stinkin' context.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I'm concerned, the blue design is flawed to start with (but maybe that's just me). Also, we don't have this sort of soda where I'm from. But the classic types are iconic anywhere you go.

Tools I use most often would have to be vinyl records, MPC1000 and my DAW (ableton). newlinechar  newlinechar Everything I sample has always been sourced from records. Drums, and samples. I personally separate 'drums' (one shot drum samples) and samples, which are pieces of a composition. newlinechar For me, I look for samples from Jazz, disco, funk, some folk and lots of soul. Mostly black music. You develop an ear for what you want to sample, and begin to pick things out of music you would like to manipulate. newlinechar You dont' sample a sample for a specific part of it, you have to use it as a whole. That means there is more to the sample then just the vocals. Sure you can filter the bass out, but without actually damaging the sound, you are stuck with drums, keys, guitars bass and so on. Try to think of them more then just a specific piece in the sound. newlinechar  newlinechar Here are a few examples: newlinechar  newlinechar Track: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwr71AhakhA newlinechar Sample: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3_7Pu5GvZ8 newlinechar  newlinechar Track: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p763mO_XUWQ newlinechar How it was done: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZboBQ6rDrU newlinechar  newlinechar Both examples are from Daft punk, but those guys really know how to do it!

Obscurity is always great. But for some of these arguments I think the assumption is your *method* is known, and that would include any salts. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the point is that 1,000,000,000xMD5 is safer than 1xMD5, because it makes bruteforcing more expensive. As computers improve, simply raise the number of iterations to maintain a reasonable level of security. newlinechar  newlinechar From what I understand, for simply hashing passwords, running MD5 enough times to make it computationally expensive enough to deter bruteforcing gives you just as much benefit as what bcrypt does.
&gt; mmaping a file really isn't any different that allocating a big-ass array in virtual memory newlinechar  newlinechar Technically, virtual memory is usually bound by the size of physical memory + swap space size, whereas mmap'd memory is usually bound by the minimum of the address space size and file system size. newlinechar  newlinechar In either case, can we have our Haskell heap operate within that space?

Thank you for the giving me the right words. I think this is the concept I had in mind. But looking at the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation) I think that the situation for helmetted footballers is worse than the risk compensation behaviours that have become apparent following car safety improvements: the increased risk of injury/death by seatbelted drivers is still less than the risk for unseatbleted drivers; a driver wears a seltbelt, drives a little faster than he otherwise would have done, risk injury reduces 'cos of the selt belt but not as much as it should have done if his driving style had remained constant. By contrast for footballers, it may be that wearing hard helmets changed the game so much that the risks increased (rather than reduced by less than they should have done). The helmets probably made it look initially safer - less blood injury - but no one was monitoring the jelly being shaken up inside the football player skulls.
that would probably kill my love life.
Unionising the industry would be a disaster. The net negative programmer that is finally leaving will be there for an eternity. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with unions is it is not a great big brotherhood of programmers. We really want higher recruitment standards and a greater focus on doing things properly. The legacy drive to try and turn programming into an assembly line process is what we need to undo. This isn't in the interests of a lot of programmers. Many would find themselves out of a job if we start doing things properly. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why professional/unionised industries end up a disaster. They don't do things properly, they do whatever keeps the weakest workers in their job.

Yes, and if the material upon which they are to take notes and learn from consists of a recitation of the slides, with no discussion, no engagement with the audience, no insight or rhetoric, no attempt to explain the content, the lecturer has added *zero* value to the textbook, and can be summarily discarded.

That's a fair assessment. I played as a flanker (loose forward) and I didn't bang heads that often. But I certainly had an occasional hit that had me seeing stars.

When you watch [good rugby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO1Cui1Sr3Q), you'll see people turning to the side as they anticipate a tackle.

The consensus that I've experienced among rugby players is that football armor does more harm than good (some exceptions being light chest armor, which prevents a lot of broken collar bones in rugby, and scrum caps). newlinechar  newlinechar With football gear, you feel more invincible, you make riskier tackles as a result, and you're hitting the other guy with hard plastic(?) instead of muscle (in addition to raw strength, strong muscles also provide natural padding). newlinechar  newlinechar Those are my two cents.

In general, even a trained fighter will never willingly go up against someone who's got more than 20 pounds on them. That's why there are weight classes in boxing and MMA.

&gt;There is history of abuse (particularly in cases where the subject is not mentally competent) which makes for a compelling argument. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that assisted suicide is illegal in most of the world and has been for as long as suicide has (i.e. pretty much forever), where and when exactly did this history of abuse happen? People always use this argument, but when you look at the evidence, it's totally fallacious; there was and is no opportunity to abuse it in most places and in those that have legalised it, there is no evidence that anyone has abused the systems in place. Using a completely hypothetical situation to force your will onto others is wrong.
Can you offer a better explanation?

Hmm, it does only come with 2 GB of RAM. But this is DDR3 RAM. And it's not merely DDR3 RAM; it's DDR3 RAM that's significantly faster than the DDR2 RAM in your MacBook. newlinechar  newlinechar The processor is also not merely 100 MHz faster in clockspeed. It's Penryn whereas yours is Merom. The chipset is also vastly improved. While your laptop can only support up to 3 GB of RAM, the new MBP can take up to 4 GB of RAM. newlinechar  newlinechar The MBP is lighter while lasting far longer on battery, and does this with the battery being just slightly higher capacity. The trackpad is multitouch. The backlight is LED instead of CCFL. Geekbench scores for the new MBP are 25% better than those of the MacBook you have. The _minimum_ size of hard drive you can get now is the same as the _maximum_ size before. newlinechar  newlinechar If you only compare the first 3-4 major features you think of, those aren't likely to change over 3 years, especially not when the features you think of are processor speed (which hasn't gone up significantly since maybe 2006), amount of RAM (which hasn't gone up significantly for the last few years), screen resolution (which, sadly, has gone _down_ over the last few years), and DVD burner speed/type. There's just not much room for improvement in these specifications. Where this is room is in performance given the same numbers. For example, 2.26 GHz today is a lot faster than 2.4 GHz in, say, 2005, because the processors today are a lot faster and cooler for a given clockspeed. newlinechar  newlinechar By carefully selecting the specifications you compare, you can make almost any two laptops seem like the same thing, so it's no wonder you're apparently disappointed.
Money and support is the goal.  They know that the only way they will lose political support in the United States is if the American public opinion turns against them.

He's talking about threaded replies. Much like Reddit, Gmail threads all emails with matching subjects together, instead of showing the individual responses separately. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, in Outlook, I send a message called 'About those TPS reports.' It goes to the Sent box. When the other person replies, I see only 'Re: About those TPS reports.' on the incoming mail. Future replies will all be their own, individual messages. newlinechar  newlinechar In Gmail, if I send a message called 'About those TPS reports.' When the reply comes in, I see my original email header with my name as the sender, then a bolded name of the reply. Clicking on it will show *both* messages, with mine collapsed above the reply. Future replies will be appended to this thread. When searching, I need only find the original message and everything below it will be in-line, instead of having 14 different replies. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem arises when some jackass changes the reply subject to something like 'Fuck your TPS reports, I quit.' when they reply. This breaks the thread and creates an entire new one. Proper email etiquette for decades has insisted that you *do not change the subject* when replying, but people have been doing it for almost as long because it wasn't *that* big a deal. newlinechar  newlinechar The whole single-message-at-a-time thing made sense in the days of like [Elm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_%28e-mail_client%29) but it is remarkably stupid and inefficient when using a GUI.

That argument doesn't make any sense for determining whether it is a proper noun or not. The Internet is a computer network.

The Internet is to a computer network the same as Route 66 is to a road.  newlinechar In most popular usages, the Internet refers to the specific global network of computers, thus it is a proper noun, thus it *should* be capitalized.  newlinechar

Media Player Classic Home Cinema is actually a better player for video files than VLC, as it supports FFDShow and thus DXVA (allows you to use a GPU for faster/more efficient playback), avisynth and built-in filters.

It took me a long time to get my head around this aspect of classical mythology.  If there were two or more conflicting versions of a myth I'd try and figure out which was the 'right' one - as if there was a pure source you could trace the story back to if you looked widely enough.  But these stories were constantly evolving...as Greek culture expanded foreign gods were often renamed and worked into the existing fabric of the myth, like you say. Once you realise you have to be able to hold two opposing ideas in your head at the same time, interpreting and enjoying the batshit insane wtf-ery of classical myth is so much easier.  It also puts to bed the kind of 'Heracles/Hercules' pedantry people like to indulge in -- the people who first told the story wouldn't even ascribe most of the legends to the name. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Dionysus, he was apparently a late import from Asia  so there are a lot of different versions; I just threw together what I could remember from The Bacchae. :p Glad to see another fan of the Hellenic, I enjoyed reading your comments.

I'm sorry, but the belief that improving general [and infant!] mortality rates will somehow lower birth rates is naive and absurd. You go on to illustrate your failure to grasp the economic problem. Improving the economy (which will lead to a stronger and more unified government) will require *less* aid. The more free food and goods that are given to each country, the more the local industry suffers; after all, who can compete with free? newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is extremely complex, but what sanrabb said is essentially true. We must view foreign aid as a finite resource that won't be available forever. When we view countries where aid is being distributed, a common occurrence is an *increase* in birth rate. Naturally, uneducated populations with limited access to birth control will reproduce until their food supply runs out. The option is to either educate the population *intensively* and *all at once*, as well as supply them with unlimited options for birth control; or cut off the aid which is actually devastating to both reproduction rates and their local economy. I view the former as unrealistic. Cultural practises like having large families die hard, and I don't feel any amount of education will change that. This is why I firmly believe that in order to save more lives in the future, some must be lost now.
No, I meant the use of quotes as indirection. The correct answer then is: 'what happens when he and his family need to eat is irrelevant and has no influence on justification of minimum wage.' That is, whether minimum wage prevents people from starving or not (assuming we believe that minimum wage makes people unable to find work) can not serve as justification for minimum wage, because there exists no right to be employed or fed.

I'd help you out if I could.  I found it out while trying to explain how Democratic Massachusetts is to a German kid I lived with for a while.  I looked up (on Wikipedia) maps of the Presidential election results, expecting MA to be a blue state for a long, long time (I remember having seeing a 'Don't blame me, I'm from Massachusetts' pin my parents had, so I knew it had been fairly Democratic since at least '72) . newlinechar  newlinechar I was a bit taken aback by the fact that, apparently, the state had 'gone red' in 1996.  Which I was 90% sure was false.  As I kept going through the years, I got to 1972, which showed the entire US, save MA, as blue.  This I was 100% sure was false; Nixon won the '72 election 49 states to 1.  So, I did some poking on Google and discovered that explanation somewhere.  This was 4 years ago, so I'll never know where it was originally, but I was able to find an explanation [here](http://www.word-detective.com/2007/06/07/blue-state-red-state/) and [here](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1430/). newlinechar  newlinechar Now the maps of results all the elections have been changed on Wikipedia, but the through the page history I tracked down maps from the National Atlas, viewable [here](http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/elections.html), that agreed with this pattern.  So though these websites aren't ones I've ever seen before, and thus can't vouch for them, they support a pretty clear pattern that would seem to be quite unlikely to have occurred coincidentally -- and seems fairly random without that explanation. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr: No, I wouldn't mind, but don't know of the original.  I post this fact any time this question (what's the weirdest fact you know?) comes up, though, so it's not impossible that a few days ago you read me commenting literally verbatim what I wrote above.  In any case, through the National Atlas and some pattern recognition, it seems to hold true.

It varies.  In the Royal Navy (and later in the USN which was its direct descendant) responsible captains demanded that midshipmen come aboard with basic navigational equipment including sextants.  In order to 'pass' for lieutenant, one of the skill-sets that a young gentleman needed to demonstrate was mastery of basic navigation.  Foremast hands were not expected to know these things but it was often the case that sailors pressed from merchantmen did have at least a nodding acquaintance with navigation and it was not unusual, in unrated ships, for a master mariner to stand a watch in lieu of a commissioned or warrant officer.   newlinechar  newlinechar Which is just to say that I cordially disagree; most captains wanted as many navigation-understanding hands aboard as was possible or realistic.

This is true for any hash.  If you have a n-bit hash, there are 2^n (exponent) possible hash outputs given any possible starting plaintext.  However, after the first hash, this means there are only 2^n inputs for the next iteration.  It's very unlikely that each hash output, when hashed again yields a unique value.  So, the search space is reduced to something less than 2^n.  And so on.

I don't mind in the least when the month gets spelled out like in the article you mention. It's obviously the most legible. Just as important however is the fact that it's impossible to get confused with something else. The world uses 3 distinct date formats, and 2 of them are very similar. The US uses MM-DD-YYYY, and much of the rest of the world uses DD-MM-YYYY. For this reason I believe that they each render the other useless, because for many dates the user has no way of knowing which one is in use. So, for legibility, the only logical choice is having the month spelled out. newlinechar  newlinechar For cataloging purposes, or any type of systematic dating, the one that makes the most sense is the ISO standard of YYYY-MM-DD. It sorts itself alphabetically/numerically, and there is no competing format to confuse it with.

Done. Could have maybe thought of something better and quoted a whole raft of stats, but was pressed for time. newlinechar  newlinechar Here is the complaint: newlinechar  newlinechar Your piece entitled 'Women abuse strategy 'inadequate'' gave a very biased account of violence in the UK. It talked about instances of violence against women and what is being done about it. What it neglected to mention in any way was the men are the primary victims of violence in the UK. If you need any evidence for this, please look at any government crime statistics that shows victim break down by gender. newlinechar  newlinechar I feel that this is important because you are painting a picture of women somehow being a social group with some sort of special status when it comes to violence. If men are the primary victims of violence this is obviously absurd. newlinechar  newlinechar The article specifically mentioned domestic violence. Around 1/3rd of all domestic violence fatalities in the UK is male. While it is true that this is a minority, it is also true that it is a very large minority. Your failure to report this was unbalanced.

No, its volume *is* finite. Consider this... you can add an infinite number of numbers together and get a finite answer. Sounds impossible? Work out 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... and keep going for ever. The answer (you can't actually work it out by doing all the adding, but mathematicians know a short cut) is 2, which is finite. newlinechar  newlinechar Something similar is going on with Gabriel's horn. If you cut it up into slices like salami, you get an infinite number of them (because the shape extends to infinity), but if you add up the volume of all these slices, then because of the special shape of this object, you get a finite answer. Again, mathematicians can do this because they know a short cut, which is calculus. (Note that this isn't true for any infinitely long shape - an infinitely long cylinder has an infinite surface area *and* an infinite volume.) newlinechar

I'm a wife now for over 8 years. If this chick emailed me with this nonsense I'd be disgusted and angry with her. I don't fucking care if my husband chats up some cam-whore and sees tits. I don't need to be asked for permission every time he wanks either. He is not out to replace me, and it is unlikely he would find a suitable long-term partner while he is looking for porn. I recognize that he is an intelligent and rational human being who can enjoy sex and value the comfortable life our relationship provides *at the same time*. I would not be concerned about him respecting me any less, desiring me any less, or loving me any less if he slept with someone different every day. It's just intimacy with someone else, not a plot to deceive or destroy me, not a violation of some emotional monopoly I'm supposed to have over him, not theft of property, nor defamation of character. It really pisses me off that not only are there women out there who ruin their own relationships with this petty jealousy and insecurity crap, there are others who delight in helping them do it by 'catching' these dirty lying men. 
It is an assumption.

Yeah, you hit the nail on the head with that one.  Except I always really liked Tom Cruise.  Up until around the time of the Oprah appearances, he had handlers that carefully kept him from exposing too much of his idiocy to the public and thus had built a kind of mystique to those of us who didn't pay too much attention to the tabloids and such.  He seemed like a larger than life sort of figure, and I have a soft spot for those - they appeal to the romantic in me. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then he ruined it all.  I mean, I knew he was a Scientologist, and that always gives me pause, but the degree to which he made a fool of himself pretty much ruined my enjoyment of his movies.  Now whenever I see him, instead of seeing him as a character in a movie, I see Tom Cruise, Scientologist-and-all-around-nutbag-at-large. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And that's part of the problem.  When you don't know all these personal details about an actor, it's easier to see them as a blank slate on which an interesting character can be built.  Even someone as famous and marginally talented as Tom Cruise - you can believe they are the character you're seeing because you don't have all this baggage you're carrying around about them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So yeah, in short, I agree.  In fact, I'd even extend that position to cover just about anyone except close personal friends and family.  I don't want to read my dentist's Twitter.  I could care less about a business associate's Facebook.  I don't want to know what my barista had for breakfast.  I just don't want those connections - it's easier to deal with people when they fulfill a role, and you don't have to see them as a whole person.  Sad and a little scary, but true - I've got enough to worry about in my own life without considering all the trials and tribulations of people I hardly know. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lots of people enjoy that.  Me, I think it just gets in the way.

We really aren't, is the funny thing.  Shipping infrastructure is weak, but we have plenty of resources to go around.  The irony is that building that infrastructure would rapidly promote higher standards of living, which have been shown to bring down birth rates, not bring them up.

Perhaps. The point is I find the most interesting articles to be from domain specialists. Rare people who either have specific inside knowledge of an interesting system or people who have studied a particular field in depth. With a journal, no matter what the technical background of their staff, they are never going to be able to cover topics in the depth and detail that such experts can. Effectively a journal is going to struggle to match my examples of de Icaza and Schneier unless they actively employed de Icaza and Schneier as journalists. newlinechar  newlinechar The lack of editorial oversight is a downside. However I found the lack of community to be a bigger problem. People who read magazines form a community in a way that you won't get with blog posts whatever their content. I believe this is in fact the problem reddit really solves. It isn't the aggregation of content that makes it compelling. It is the aggregation of a like minded community.

First of all, newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;both x and y are less exact than z. newlinechar  newlinechar Your mistake is to assume that statement z is exact in its predictions. It has a probability of one (for *it allows all states of affairs*), but it tells us nothing. For instance, an analogous theory would be 'The ball will fall within one millimeter of the coordinates x1,y1,z1, or the coordinates x2,y2,z2 or the coordinates ...' And so on for all the possible outcomes. It's not a tautology, but it has no predictive power, since it predicts contradictory results. newlinechar  newlinechar But that's irrelevant to the main point: my interpretation of probability is nowhere near the second option. I prefer it when people ask me how I would respond to a question, rather than guess.  newlinechar  newlinechar If, for instance, I was betting on a roulette wheel that always came up on '16', or on a coin that always came up 'heads', I would want to examine the coin or roulette wheel *for it is not behaving as roulette wheels or coins are designed to behave*. These supposedly 'random' games of chance are not exhibiting random behavior. newlinechar  newlinechar Yet, I fail to see how your objection would relate to the probability of a theory that is universal in scope, that is, the theory that predicts 'the next roll of the die will be 3, then 2, then 5, then 4 ...' and so on. Those are the theories scientists are interested in, not 'the next roll of the die will be 1, or 2, or 3 ...' and so on. The results of your theory that is compatible with all states of affairs are mutually exclusive, not predicting with precision independent events.  newlinechar  newlinechar I refer to this as you increase the content, or the more a theory predicts, it becomes less probable. And if the theory is corroborated each time, that doesn't detract from the fact that while we may psychologically treat is as more probable (for we are pattern-seeking animals), it is still immensely improbable in the sense of the probability calculus. newlinechar  newlinechar You've got me bass ackwards. I am saying that probability is logically inverse to the content of a theory. Or, the more independent events a theory predicts (that is, the more a theory rules out certain states of affairs), the less probable the theory. It has nothing to do with consistency.
You need to understand that logical thinking often goes straight out the window as soon as emotional panic takes hold.

Ugh, you're reeking with bias. You are making the connection between the use of white phosphorous and the reprimand. Read the quote.

I think the more connected a person is with God and His will, the more likely they are to pray for things that God is already working on.

But if I am concerned with the things God wants I will pray for things that are already more likely to happen.

Yes, I have noticed good gains. It is just that you can't really do SS and C25K at the same time easily. SS utterly crushes your legs with those Power Cleans, Deadlifts and Full Squats, but since SS benefits your running skill (strengthens legs bones, muscles, and tightens tendons), I do SS and do one week of C25K every the second other week. I have not noticed any trouble to keep up with the plan by doing so, but every now and then I do the first week at a higher pace just for fun.

I always hated transporter accident episodes.  The transporter is responsible for so much crap. Tuvix, Thomas Riker, transporting into the mirror universe, turning Picard, Ro and Guinan into children, people being stuck in some weird stasis and Barclay has to pull them out, the list is virtually endless.    I always felt when they did a transporter disaster episode they were using a cheap gimmick to pose an eventually moral question or teach some lesson about humanity. If a transporter could do all of this crap, then why on earth did people keep using it.  I believe I'd continue to take the ENT approach and use it as a last resort.  I understand why the invented it (in TOS doing shuttle transport would've been expensive set-wise), but I just wish they didn't do so many episodes concerning some disaster around it while ALSO talking about how safe it was continously in the faces of McCoy or Pulaski

Regardless, I don't mind congratulating that minority of Mormons that has stepped up and publicly criticized its church's Prop 8 campaign.

&gt; What I cant believe is that you treat modern evolution theory as 100% truth, as verifiable as 2+2=4. And I have I feeling that you still wonder why I view the writings of the bible(old and new testament) the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar Evolution is as proven to occur as anything else we can be sure of.  The sun will rise tomorrow, light travels at 186,000 miles per second, and living things evolve.  These are facts. newlinechar  newlinechar Modern evolutionary theory is the explanatory framework that we use to explain **WHY** and **HOW** living things evolve.  There are details still being worked out, but the basics of the theory are sound, and have been verified many times, **without being falsified.**   newlinechar  newlinechar We can prove 2+2=4 because that's math.

Cool story, Hansel.
So interesting. I love stories like that.
White males have a certain privilege to be not noticed. That means when you pick 5 white males, and 1 black guy, you think to yourself 'I picked one black guy, I'm so multicultural!'. White is the 'default'. When we see a default, we don't notice. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, getting to my point with that: when you see a lot of Asians in your academic environment, and you think to yourself 'Wow, there's a lot of Asians, because obviously they are stereotyped to be intelligent.' this is the exact same effect. People are still affected by white privilege even if they aren't racist, and it doesn't change the fact that white people are simply more likely to get what they want in our culture, even over your cultures/races that stereotypically doing better in our culture. There is no rule saying people cannot be racist against a well-educated person. newlinechar  newlinechar And then with your parting comment you are seemingly trying to attack me here because I said nothing about disagreeing with whites getting scholarships, because that is also ridiculous. You seem to be missing my point. All I am saying is that THESE scholarships are affirmative action for race, and giving a white-only scholarship in that context is the same thing as giving a need-based scholarship to high-class families.
The bit about release schedules was insightful, and I think he's spot on about this being more about Cameron's desire for recognition then any sort of desire to tell a particular story.

I did not say it does not have 'plenty of action' (subjective).  In other words the series IMO concentrates a lot less on action and more on technology / politics / dialogue (felt that way to me for the most part, especially Innocence movies).  I guess I didn't make it clear that this is only my opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Let me clarify.  I do not think they are doing themselves a favor by starting with the manga and saying that there will be lots of action.  It would help wonders for my impressions of this film if they instead said something to the effect that they would focus on the technology and how they would keep things relevant, understandable, and just as techie as the original.  What always drew me back to GITS was not the action in the slightest, it was the plot. newlinechar  newlinechar Also there was that one movie [Avalon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267287/) that had a lot of similarities to GITS (when I first saw it people were saying it was supposed to basically BE a live action GITS).  There was action, slow pacing, atmosphere... but a very shallow plot for the most part.  It was good in its own right, but if this is what Spielberg is going to do with GITS then I would rather pass.  He's better off doing something like Avalon which may be related but completely separate from the GITS series.

It was stolen by an adult. I was sleeping underneath the ramp up to that coffee shop by jack in the box, behind the old grandfather pizza/US bank, and I really had to pee. I left my cat there as it was sleeping under the blankets and tied up anyways, and I left all my stuff there too. I just walked across reservoir park, went to the bathroom, walked back and it was gone. A guy came by the next night saying he had stolen it, and laughed at me. I have no idea where it is now.. it was a cool cat. It walked on a leash even.

Well, I'm a student, these were more peers and friends than coworkers.  We have a bastardized group of computers in this one room that aren't attached to the main network at my school. Anyway, people always use this room to go on Facebook, and always forget to log off. So me and a few buddies made it our job to make sure that they remembered.   It was crude but mostly harmless stuff, like changing people's names to  Haywood Jablomee and changing birthdays and etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, this girl left her Facebook on for like the fifth time, and we put her into a relationship with Herright Hand.

A+ for reading comprehension. There was a group of gay men who could not control their urges and had their way with easily accessible, young men. calling them pedos is a stretch since the majority of the boys were not pre-pubescent and the fact that the priests admitted to being gay and do not prefer children.  the boys just happen to be easily accessible but they prefer men in general. newlinechar  newlinechar secondly, since removing gays from the clergy, the problem has basically gone away.

&gt; They aren't necessarily 'against' your side, either newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, that would be why I used the word 'necessarily.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Somehow, someone got it in their head that the debate over science is a political struggle between scientists and 'anti-scientists' (creationist, or whoever). newlinechar  newlinechar It's reasonably fair to simplify the debate into scientists (the overwhelming majority of whom support evolution) and non-scientists (more than half of whom reject it). Scientists are expected to accept evolution because they understand that (and usually why) it's the best explanation of human origin. When a scientist rejects evolution, it's a statistical outlier and probably a warning sign. For non-scientists, it's a toss-up,  even among engineers, philosophers, and other educated groups. When non-scientists accept evolution, it's a victory for rational inquiry.  newlinechar  newlinechar So again, I'm not grouping philosophers on either side of the question because it's not as simple as A accepts X and B denies X. A reliably accepts X, but B could go either way. Scientists are automatically 'from our side' because it's a scientific debate. Philosophers - even the science-minded among you - aren't. The distinction remains irrelevant to actual arguments.
Ah, you beat me to it. :) newlinechar  newlinechar It's interesting that the author mentions poker players but doesn't seem to note the clear distinction in the poker literature between optimal and maximal play.

The wikipedia picture of the Reed reactor is of the same model TRIGA that the University of Texas used to operate in the Taylor building (they have since decomissioned that one and built a newer larger TRIGA at their Balcones Research Center). I don't see anything in that picture to give you a sense of scale, but the reactor is probably about a yard across, sitting at the bottom of a pool of water 20 or so feet deep. You could stand on the grating over the water while the reactor was cooking away just below you. And yes, your scrotum does tighten when you're standing just above a nuclear reactor glowing an eerie blue with nothing but an aluminum grate and a bit of water between you.

.com is not technically US specific, but there isn't anything nefarious about have a '.com.pk' either. Many countries with a thriving internet presence will segment out sections of their national domain to be commerical in the same fashion as '.com'. As the previous poster mentioned, the UK does it with '.co.uk', where '.co' is the same as '.com'. newlinechar  newlinechar [Here is the link to the formal domain structure of pakistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.pk). IMO it's the exact opposite of the claim that 'they're trying to hide something'. They come right out and say it, that they're a commercial enterprise based in Pakistan. If they wanted to hide something, they would register as a '.com' and let their readers try to figure things out from there.

I live near Vermont Yankee.  I'm pro nuclear power, I think the US should encourage the development of nuclear plants as part of their energy policy.

I don't know what goes on in VT Yankee's day to day operations but, given that their fucking cooling tower collapsed, I'd rather not see them get granted another 20 year license (supposed to lapse in 2012) until they have been thoroughly inspected and audited by a non-partisan agency.

 Yeah that Wikipedia article mention it was a bit of a lucky break since the star navigation was made for missiles but the plan was scrapped so it was used for the SR-71. newlinechar  newlinechar  What amazes me is the star navigation device the Astro-Inertial Navigation System (ANS), can see stars during the day (obviously the our sun is a star). newlinechar  newlinechar  I've read about something else interesting and possibly related, a weird phenomenon where a person at the bottom of a well or a deep hole can see stars (not from falling into it) if they look up, even during the day. I wonder if the ANS uses a similar method for being able to see stars during the day, I doubt Infrared sensor technology existed when the ANS was created. newlinechar  newlinechar  edit: Snopes says no to [stars from the bottom of a well](http://www.snopes.com/science/well.asp).

They never shut off a waterfall. They dumped the wood from Glacier Point. There is a small waterfall that falls from near where the wood was dropped, but never was a waterfall shut off. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to work in the valley and tourists would consistently ask us, 'What time do the waterfalls get shut off?' like it was something that happened on a nightly basis.

I think the human mind is great actually but theres only a limited amount amount of chemicals, electrical signals and pure poundage . I think the brain compensates for this by fragmenting memories into smaller pieces that when are recalled are reconstructed. Our memories may seem limitless because we can never recall what we forget and on a daily basis of taking in information we do forget a lot of useless info. newlinechar  newlinechar To be clear I think human brains are well beyond the petabyte level in terms of raw information stored in such as audio visual. Thats not even considering all the information it takes to run the body...

Welcome to the revolution! newlinechar  newlinechar I'm with you on the flu shot announcement, as well, but at least that announcement seems slightly more relevant and useful. That is to say we're at a higher risk of getting the flu, than being attacked by terrorists. Still, both announcements are unnecessary. By the MBTA's risk assessment logic, a voice should be booming at every intersection, telling us to look both ways and proceed with caution, since technically we're at the highest risk of getting in a car accident, over both flu and terrorist attack combined.

Hmm, usually I write code that 'generates' code. This code is already data. Parentheses are an external thing. Generated code does not use any parentheses. newlinechar  newlinechar For example I write a function to generate code that squares an argument: newlinechar  newlinechar     (defun gen-squared (arg) newlinechar       (list '* arg arg)) newlinechar  newlinechar Note that we don't write: newlinechar  newlinechar     (defun gen-squared (arg) newlinechar       (list '|(| '* arg arg '|)| )) newlinechar  newlinechar Parentheses are not a part of code generation. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if we WANT to write code, we can use PPRINT - which pretty prints the expression to a character stream (to a file, to the terminal, ...). newlinechar  newlinechar    (pprint (gen-squared 10)) newlinechar  newlinechar Above pretty prints the code that is generated by GE-SQUARED. newlinechar  newlinechar Only here is where we get parentheses. But it would be perfectly fine if we have a different pretty printer, which writes code in some form of infix syntax. Then we need a different reader, to read that back. That would be mostly equivalent. You can write code and read code - in a different syntax.  newlinechar  newlinechar Summary: code generation is independent from the data syntax, because it is in-memory and does not use s-expressions (s-expressions are only external syntax). Code generation in Lisp is special, because there is a primitive way to represent code as data (not as strings). newlinechar  newlinechar There must be some other reason, 'why parens rock'. newlinechar  newlinechar

Spiders don't have penises. Instead, they have pedipalps, those two appendiges near the mouth. In males, pedipalps are notably larger than in females. They are used to store (not to produce) sperm; the fecondation usually happens when the male inserts a pedipalp in the female's epigyne, an opening in the lower abdomen.  newlinechar Also, in most species the male's abdomen is narrower than the female's. newlinechar I should point out that I'm not a spider expert, just an enthusiast, so I could be wrong in identyfing the sex of this spider.

You have no contract. You get paid cash. You've never received a payslip. You are unclear if you are paying taxes or not. This is pretty much the definition of working under the table.

If you want a suggestion, run slower.

Absolutely.  My wife and I just recently had a baby boy (3 months last Friday!), so we've talked a lot about 'well what if we got pregnant earlier/what if we weren't ready/etc'.  I couldn't personally fathom giving one of my children up.  If I did or had to for some reason, I really couldn't think of a better place for him/her to go to than a m/m or f/f couple.  Why? newlinechar  newlinechar 1) I've yet to meet a gay couple that isn't nice or show their love to each other.  On the other hand, I've met plenty of straight couples who aren't nice to each other, show absolutely no love to one another, and so fourth.  newlinechar  newlinechar I live in CA so I've got a bunch of gay couples as friends and have had the pleasure of informally meeting plenty others.  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) It's important that this generation of children learn that if they have a friend who has two mommies or two daddies, there's nothing 'abnormal' about that.  This is something I will go out of my way to teach my son if he asks about it.    newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Exactly the experience you pointed out above.  newlinechar  newlinechar Enough about me, though.

You've got more or less the right idea. Most commercial software packages for animation, modelling and rendering include both modeler and renderer, and they appear to the user as a single program (though often they are not). newlinechar  newlinechar Blender has both renderer and modeler components; POVRay is only a renderer. Blender exports to a variety of formats, but I don't know how useful any of them are for renderers (certainly, POVRay is right out, but there are other ray-tracers out there). As I mentioned previously, there are modelers available for POVRay; the ecosystem for POVRay is such that you can have modelers that export to multiple renderers (of which POVRay is only one) and multiple modelers that export to POVRay. This, theoretically, lets the community be more diverse, and it follows the UNIX edict of 'do one thing, very well'. POVRay renders scenes, very well.

You are right that climate change benefits certain big businesses and certain governments and politicians. You will also agree that certain big businesses and certain government bodies and politicians also benefit from it being no true. newlinechar  newlinechar So I think if you look at which interests are winning, I think it is those that benefit from it not being true. why? Because most scientists say we are too late. That if we really believed in it, we would have done something 20 years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Its obvious though that those that stand to benefit are certainly gaining more power. However, its clear that the biggest of businesses, and the biggest of governments (USA) have no interest in climate change being true. Because our policies are completely impotent in that regard.

I think a better phrasing should be: newlinechar  newlinechar #1. Companies hire labor where the marginal benefit of said labor &gt; the marginal cost of labor (wages). newlinechar #2. When wages are artificially high, companies abstain from hiring labor because the marginal cost (wages) is greater than the marginal benefit. newlinechar #3. These wages that go unsold to companies causes a surplus of labor in the market...this labor is unproductive and sits fallow. newlinechar #4. Because average wages are so low now (due to the inefficiency of unemployment), people can afford to consume only little, and therefore companies may drive down the cost of their products in order to stimulate consumption. newlinechar #5. As companies reduce costs, the labor that at one time *was* marginally beneficial is no longer beneficial, and companies fire said individuals. newlinechar  newlinechar MISSING FROM THE EQUATION: newlinechar  newlinechar #6. Individuals, having been fired from their jobs, compete for new jobs. Their competition drives down the price at which they sell their labor (wages). newlinechar #7. Because wages have fallen, companies can afford to hire individuals who previously would not have benefited the company greater than their cost (wages) to the company. newlinechar  newlinechar Notice that #6 is the market correction that would naturally occur, but the government deems this illegal, and therefore the market will continue in a state of non-equilibrium. newlinechar  newlinechar Pernicious indeed.

Hmmm... My character development technique was probably influenced by stuff I read on the net.  Although I Kurt Vonnegut's stories aren't my favorites, I've found several of his How-To essays and quotes on writing to be very extremely illuminating: newlinechar  newlinechar For example he suggests not using flowery verbs when writing dialog.  Just use: 'he said', and not 'he exclaimed, he barked, he moaned, etc.'  As you can see I take that to heart. and rarely break from it. newlinechar  newlinechar He also suggests starting a story as closely to the end as possible.  Respect your reader, and don't waste their time.  I also take that to heart. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as writing characters goes- the most helpful thing I've ever heard was in that amazingly long and snarky youtube commentary on Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  newlinechar  newlinechar The critic challenged his friends to describe both the old and new Star Wars characters without talking about their jobs or what they did in the film.   Everyone had an easy time describing Luke, Han Solo, and Leia- but no one could think of anything for Qui-Gan, young Obi-Wan, or Queen Amidala/Padme.   That was a real eye opener to me.  It let me know that I should have certain definitive traits in mind for my characters, and that those traits should be expressed frequently through their dialog. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: as far as book recommendations: 'The Time Travelers Wife' is a good read, and just about the most character-driven Sci-Fi I've seen.

It's bad enough that you need to worry about organizing, planning, driving all the extras that come with doing all the therapies, but to have to worry about how you're going to pay for those?

As 'potential mate' material though I look for my match - who wants what I want, understands what I understand, etc.  A man that doesn't understand what it's like to be black in America simply can't relate to me as well as someone who does and can understand my life experiences on that level.  I mean I could settle for someone who tries and just accept he'll never really 'get it' but hell, I get frustrated with people who don't get my sense of humor, so I don't know if I could handle that for long.

Im not so sure that its the number of laws, so much as its the scope of the municipal unit. Ideally, a city like NYC should have the largest government possible, given its density and requirements for infrastructure, utilities, and services. NYC should be free to govern itself as it pleases, even if that means regulating the amount of salt in restaurant plates or the types of goods that can be sold within its borders. But NYC should not be plundered by upstate exurbs, or federal redistributive schemes (that wind up benefiting 'red' states the most). newlinechar  newlinechar There is a happy medium between those who would use government towards progress and those who consider it a moral hazard in and of itself...I believe that medium to be agreeing on smaller administrative groupings that minimize the impact of one distinct group of people on another.

No, it's not much for imaginative work, but it is helpful for folks who can't get past trying to draw things out of named component parts, as opposed to seeing shapes and values.  I didn't need it, by the time I checked the book out, but it is a good reminder to dissociate what you think you know from what you see.  From what I can tell, it's great for adults who have never really tried drawing from life.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for drawing and painting from the imagination, I have found being able to draw things you see to be a huge help in extrapolating things that don't exist.

&gt; I would happily eat eggs if they came from my own pet chickens, in fact I plan on keeping some of my own when I get my own place. Keeping hens is not really viable in a college dorm, heh. newlinechar  newlinechar Hehe, cool. I'd like to keep chickens someday. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; However there are multiple problems with 'free range' eggs. First of all the term is very loosely regulated, so there are plenty of so-called free range farms that are not much better than battery farms (see this for example http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/wp-content/uploads/chickens.jpg). And of course the hens are slaughtered like any other when they are no longer productive; there's no 'retirement home' for spent hens. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. You've clarified the vagaries of 'free range' -- although I'd mention that, in the UK, the term is better-regulated than in the US. It's still inadequate. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But the more fundamental issue is the killing of male chicks at hatcheries. Since the males don't they eggs, they are useless to the industry and literally ground up alive once their sex is determined. Even at the largely mythical 'humane' egg farm, there's no way around this problem. Even if the male chicks weren't killed, they would probably just be raised for meat; I sincerely doubt there's a demand for hundreds of millions of pet roosters. newlinechar  newlinechar That's something of a knockout blow. Thank you for responding.

Excellent. It may be productive to visit the PTO meetings of the schools you currently serve to see if they can kick back any money to you.  newlinechar  newlinechar Give them an itemized list of your expenses for visiting their school, and ask for a specific sum to cover a specific expense that they'll feel good about paying for. They won't pay for your time. They'll dislike paying for your gas/travel expenses. They might go for paying the at-cost value of the vegetables you give away. Collect phone numbers and e-mail addresses while you're at the meetings so you don't necessarily have to revisit them every year/month/whatever.

Yes, Piper was mostly Syd's album, and Saucerful less so. That's when Gilmour came in to try and copy Syd's style for a while, and the sound morphed from there to Roger exerting his personal influence on the sound more and more until Final Cut, which was basically a Roger Waters solo album as much as Piper was a Syd solo album. newlinechar  newlinechar There are many Floyd fans that are basically Syd and pre-darkside era fans. They are a smaller and dedicated group with a serious Cult following. I have Piper on CD, Mono 30th anniversary CD and Vinyl, as well as the Syd Solo albums on CD. I collected all the CDs up until the Wall, and didn't bother with final cut after listening to a couple Waters solo albums. I rarely listen to anything past Meddle anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar If you haven't heard the early singles, I suggest checking out Arnold Layne and See Emily play, their chart topping singles (in the UK at least) that put them on the map. They wouldn't have any hit singles again until Dark Side.
In Human Sexuality our professor (who holds no radical views) had personally witnessed a situation where, apparently, a woman went from straight to lesbian.  Her conversion was in response to decades of abuse.  She grew up with an abusive father only to marry an abusive husband.  It took her a while to escape both relationships but after doing so was apparently unable to have an emotional connection with a man again (if she ever did) and entered into a romantic relationship with a woman.  Whether sex was a component of the relationship was unknown.  It's possible she was a closeted lesbian before so a solid conclusion can't really be reached.

I'm sorry if this is nagging, but....what is it that makes this more favorable?  Is it just some possesive thing of being the only one to 'have' her, or like, being part of a more exclusive club (because, supposidly the girl is more selective about who she has slept with)? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm nowhere near 40 partners, but I frequently find that I have more experiance than the guys I am dating.  My current boyfriend seems to resent my experiance a bit, which may be more my fault than his (I may mention past boyfriends, not having sex with them, but just in general).  He's told me before that he wishes I was a virgin.  However, I dated the guy I lost my virginity to for 3 years.  I was his first as well, and during the whole relationship, I kind of wondered what it would be like with other people.  We had great sex, but I still wondered if this was just great because it was the only sex I had ever had.  Maybe it was because I was only 19 at the time (when we broke up), and immature and wanted to explore in general.  Now I know for sure how good the sex was with him, and how amazing my current boyfriend is.  I do not regret having multiple partners (though, there are a few individuals I wouldn't have minded not sleeping with) and I don't see the problem, especially given that my current boyfriend is the best I've ever had, and I could not be any more secure in that fact (never a thought in my head to sleep with someone else to 'see what it's like').  I see my experiance as a positive, but to him it's a negative.  So...please just tell me why the less sex partners in your current girlfriends past the better?

Well, very few humans benefit in anyway from climate change. The only people who could possibly benefit are the people will be enforcing laws. Sort of how murder doesn't benefit anyone except the police and lawyers. newlinechar  newlinechar I do think you are underestimating how much the biggest of businesses and governments have to gain. Businesses have already developed new 'green' products which they can charge a premium for (this can obviously be seen as a good thing especially when the poor aren't forced to buy them.) The wealthy can pay more for cleaner products (although it's very possible that the products aren't any more than nominally green) and the poor can stick with the cheap stuff. Government benefits whenever new laws are passed. They just need to tread a little water with the voters (but how much they do is overblown). But imagine how much big businesses and government benefit if they were to tax the non-green products. It forces everyone to buy the expensive products. Meanwhile the new gov't regulations create barriers to entry (by limiting what people can sell and by raising taxation) and this hurts the labor market (making it harder for people to get jobs and therefore lowering wages). The 'biggest losers' like oil and car companies will probably receive the most subsidies to begin with as they do have the clutches on the gov't already. newlinechar  newlinechar None of this denies that AGW is real, but it does make you cognizant of who benefits and at least make you skeptical when they are the ones advocating new laws.
Along those lines, a new tuning can help, as well.

The point of the article is in fact a non-issue... no serious system uses MD5, SHA, etc directly. They all (eg MD5-Crypt and SHA512-Crypt) wrap the underlying hash function inside a more complex multi-round process which (for SHA512-Crypt, just like bcrypt) can be made incredibly expensive, easily bringing back down into the world of 1 password/(cpu*sec).
They can de-fund it, which would have the opposite of the desired effect, causing an immediate draw-down. They can't force him to keep troops there by over-funding it.
I was speaking to the connection between the Olympics and school closures, of which there is none. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you have issues with the student/teacher ratios that is different.  Those ratios affect the costs (not the other way around).  The money is allocated based on numbers of students (and the amounts are calculated assuming certain target teacher/student ratios).  More students = more money, fewer students = less money.  Whether that is enough money is a different issue that I have not addressed, but it is not impacted by the Olympics.  I haven't looked at the numbers, but I suspect that the amount of money per student has actually increased since the Olympics were announced - feel free to find some stats that contradict that.  In fact, a quick search around the intertubes suggests that the total education budget in the province has increased while, at the same time, the number of students has decreased. newlinechar  newlinechar

True, but you ignored the part where at least *some* of adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine are apparently quite common in the universe (massively increasing the likelihood of them being incorporated into other species' storage mechanisms the way they have with ours), and the part where - if something like panspermia was the case - it would make it almost certain that there are at least *some* aliens out there with GCAT-based storage mechanisms. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Assuming it must be DNA is what I call the 'fallacy of lack of imagination.'

So basically they are like different personalities taking over your body?

I can't really express what I'm trying to say but if when the doctor spoke to the voices they (as you said) stepped into your body, do you think it would be possible for them to permanatently take over? Does that make sense at all? newlinechar  newlinechar **edit:** Also, I'm curious, is your choice of nickname related to your voices at all? :) Did they choose or something like that?
If memory serves, both Arnold Layne and See Emily Play were on the collection Works (and maybe Relics?  It's been too long!), but there was also a disc released with a box set about 15 years ago which had a collection of their early singles - Apples and Oragnes, Paintbox, etc.  I certainly don't dismiss any of these out of hand, but I was not a child of the times, and much of the late 60's 'pop' music just feels weird to me.  I don't want to hang my issues on Floyd in particular, though. newlinechar  newlinechar To quickly address the Final Cut, I had that album mostly as a book end (full collection) for a long time, and bought the 'hype' that it wasn't very good and was 'only' a Waters solo album.  While the latter is absolutely true, I've since found it to be excellent, probably among my favorite post-Dark Side albums by the band.  That said, I've enjoyed Waters 'fully' solo efforts as well.  Ego and whatever else people assign to him, justifiably or not, he knows how to write intricate and moving albums. newlinechar  newlinechar The sad truth is that while Pink Floyd completely shaped my musical tastes between the ages of 13 and my early 20's, I rarely listen to them anymore at all.  This whole damn internet thingy has made getting into new music too easy, and generally the only reason I ever look back anymore is nostalgia.

in theory yes, in reality FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
&gt; In this instance, it seemed like the philosopher was trying to apply philosophical argument to something for which it is inapplicable. newlinechar  newlinechar My point was, though, that philosophical reasoning is applicable to anything to which scientific reasoning is applicable (so long as the philosopher accepts the presuppositions of science, primarily just the validity of inductive reasoning) because 'philosophical reasoning' *just is* good reasoning, and 'philosophical reasoning' and 'scientific reasoning' are thus one and the same thing.  Philosophy, done properly, tries to understand the world via optimal theoretical explanations just like science does -- the primary differences between the two are first, the kind of questions being asked (and thus the kind of things being taken for granted,) and second, the fact that a lot of science proceeds mathematically while philosophy proceeds logically (since it's hard to study, say, consciousness, using math.) newlinechar  newlinechar What you have here with respect to the critique of evolution is an instance of *bad* philosophy, not a philosopher trying to apply philosophy to something to which it is inapplicable (just like I'm sure there are lots of instances of *bad* science out there.)  A solid philosophical critique of the theory of evolution from a philosopher who accepted the presuppositions of science would be accepted by all scientists, because if it was done properly, it would be indistinguishable from the kind of reasoning produced by a scientist. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Specifically, the phenomenon of natural selection is incredibly well-supported by evidence, to the point that it probably could be considered a 'member of reality' newlinechar  newlinechar I hope I have by now pointed out why these very relevant points are all things that a good philosopher would give heed to when engaging with evolutionary theory. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; and I wonder if the philosopher has failed to realize that his accusations of tautology regarding the survival of the fittest will actually do nothing to change the fact that natural selection is real. newlinechar  newlinechar I suspect, for the record, that Fodor's argument was a great deal more complex than the link we followed made it out to be (although I also suspect that he's ultimately wrong)  It is thus just as silly for us to label Fodor as an idiot based on what we know about his work as it would have been to label Einstein an idiot having heard only a snippet of the theory of relativity (the reason we might find out that Fodor isn't an idiot, by the way, would probably have to do with a closer scrutiny of his paper revealing that the argument as portrayed in this article wasn't at all the point he was making, and not that evolution is wrong.)

Both of my cats are at the front door EVERY DAY when I get home. They are ecstatic to greet me, so I pet them and then they go on with their day.  newlinechar  newlinechar A few months ago, only one of them was at the front door when I got home, so I started to panic thinking the worst for the other one. I played a quick game of Marco-Polo with her while shaking the bag of cat food to find her location. Turns out she climbed into my ceiling in the basement and couldn't figure out how to get down. newlinechar  newlinechar Point is that cats make great pets when you don't have the ability to be home on a regular basis to ensure a dog gets let out before it shits all over the place.
You kids today.  You don't even know a c-cup when you see one.
They are both saying the government can do a better job of spending your wealth. Whether it is the Republican or the Democrat. I would say both are being irresponsible. As far as honesty goes, maybe the Democrat is being more fiscally-honest since he's taxing for the money, but right now Democrats are doing spend spend spend without taxing as well. I guess I can echo your preference for a tax-and-spend politician instead of a spend-and-spend. newlinechar  newlinechar Without inflation this country is going to be poised for two things, very quick increases in interest rate to market government debt and then subsequently, default as we cannot afford to pay. Alternatively, the solution is inflation. Since we know the US gov't won't default and that politicians are so extremely adverse to raising taxes (for obvious reasons), inflation is the most assured as it has ever been in our lives.

Go in with as much knowledge as possible and its a different story.

I'm sure they have plenty of Pro Bono lawyers signed up by now.    There was a huge list of entire firms on the site.

No, and posting these articles so you can feel self-righteous despite the fact that you're doing just as little to help people won't help either. Alternet is just as much punditry as Keith Olbermann or Glenn Beck--all are easy ways to get people emotional/political catharsis and the accolades of political reporting without actually doing anything to fix the situation. newlinechar  newlinechar Dollar Stores also sell Hispanic foods (at least where I'm at) and this includes bulk bags of rice and pintos. If you can't afford to shop at an actual grocery store, you probably shouldn't be buying applesnax, faux honey, or premade beef stew in the first place. You don't need to rely on pre-made pseudo-foods like Dinty Moore or Kraft Brand Mac and Cheese to eat. newlinechar  newlinechar Buy oatmeal, milk (go dried if you have to), eggs, (brown) rice, beans (particularly cheap), salt, pepper, red label bananas and random accouterments to accentuate these items and call it a fucking day. This is not only healthy for you, but it's dirt cheap.  newlinechar  newlinechar And please don't compare this current depression to the Great Depression (at least not at this point in time). It isn't anywhere even remotely close to it in severity. I'm all for learning lessons from history, but don't tell me the apocalypse is here and we can't do anything about it when you don't have a meaningful plan to mitigate the damage. newlinechar  newlinechar You're on reddit, the place where a majority of the stories are simply echo chambers verifying all your preconceived notions you got from reddit in the first place. We already know all of this shit. It's worse that we know the situation is bad and haven't done anything to help.  newlinechar  newlinechar We're the exiles that just sit around and bitch about how life is unfair and we've been fucked or someone is fucking us without doing anything to actually solve it. We knew about the housing crash before it happened. We knew about the tea-partiers in the beginning. We knew about the birthers in the beginning.

I agree with you.  I sort of take, 'understanding the form of the things,' to be a given in life drawing, but on reflection it really isn't.  I came to drawing through drafting, so my personal grasp of spatial relationships and forms in three dimensions was developed before I ever tried drawing from life.  I took for granted that this was part of drawing.  However, if I take a moment and think about some of the people I've been in classes with, even some who could draw very well, that kind of spatial analysis is not at all a given in drawing.  Thanks for keeping me honest. ;)

I'm so tired of seeing this tired talking point used as an excuse. Conservatives also firmly believe their party is to far to the left, and think Republicans sit in the middle, just as you think the same thing about Democrats. newlinechar  newlinechar Reddit thinks Obama isn't liberal and conservatives can point to many liberal acts Bush while president, such as giving the Federal government control over education (NCLB) and expanding Medicare, his two biggest domestic policies.  
Loop-hole! Woo! newlinechar  newlinechar Does that apply to an atheist who just marries a Christian as well then?

Guys want girls to want them.  Knowing you had many previous partners hints at you taking sex lightly.  Your current sex partner may think that he is just the dude you're hooking up with for now.  This may or may not be true, and that fact itself isn't necessarily 'good' or 'bad', but the self trivialization in his mind won't lead anywhere good. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, it may lead to the notion that you don't know what you want in a partner/ relationship.  In that case, he could have a lot more to deal with on his hands than he anticipated (baggage).   newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, my first woman had a substantial amount of experience over me.  I tried to not let it bother me at first, but it quickly became apparent that even though she did like sex, my inexperience weirder her out.

That wasn't the only reason, but it was a contributing factor.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So yea, there's what some guys will think.

Why do you need a community to pick up women? Most men go out on weekends to bars and clubs, meet women and end up with one night stands or fuck buddies.

Here, grab the Ultimate Boot CD for the hard drive diagnostic tools: newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ newlinechar  newlinechar It has diagnostic tools from Deskstar (IBM/Hitachi), Samsung, Western Digital, Maxtor, Samsung and Fujitsu. newlinechar  newlinechar There are also a ton of other awesome tools on there to diagnose problems.

Whatever the history, it is now up to the modern Taiwanese to decide their fate, not the Chinese. US arms supplies just make sure that this will not be at the barrel of a gun. One of China's cultural weaknesses is that they bear a grudge long after it becomes relevant. A sign of political maturity would be for the Chinese elite to look at Taiwan through more modern eyes and see that it matters not who runs Taiwan, just so long as there is economic and cultural exchange. I believe this is happening, though China's recent bellicosity about US arms sales belies this. newlinechar  newlinechar Please leave the US Civil War out of this. It is completely irrelevant as it's causes were very different. You clearly know very little about it as the British and French aided both sides. 
Are you referring to [camel crickets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae)? The first time I saw one of these, I tried to kill it with a shoe and it jumped across a 20 foot long room in about 3 jumps.

To be fair, she *is* lying on her back. newlinechar  newlinechar When she's upright I can generally guess a woman's bust size, and I'm usually at most *either* a single cup *or* single chest-size out (weird talent I discovered - don't ask me how I do it). newlinechar  newlinechar However all bets are off when she's laying on her back, as then you also have to factor in things like firmness of breast and degree to which they skulk around in her armpits instead of sitting on top of her chest, so there are just too many variables to account for. ;-)

Fairness.  I'd like to see a band that wasn't plastered all over the radio and supported by big labels win an award.  I'd like to see the list of best albums of the year and feel that even ONE of them deserved to win it.  The radar of Grammy judges is so narrow as to almost completely miss out on entire genres of music.  How often do deserving bands win awards while ancient hacks and has beens win awards year after year, while media darlings like Taylor Swift beat out more creative, intelligent and far reaching artists like the other ones mentioned in this thread?  The Grammys are self-congratulatory and reward the same assholes while new artists who aren't supported by major labels get zero attention and no way to break into the mainstream.  They're a sham and a mockery of music more than a celebration.  
Obviously a community is going to attract like-minded individuals, that's what makes it a community.  People use hive-mind for two reasons.   newlinechar  newlinechar * 1) to justify their own opinions if they happen to run afoul of the community newlinechar  newlinechar * 2) so that they stand out as someone who is outside of the perceived 'hive', which makes one 'indy'. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's actually a fairly interesting psychological experiment.  Reminds me of animal farm.  People felt special to be part of a unique community, but now that the community is established there needs to be another distinction separating those that are part of the new 'machine', and those that are snowflake-like in their uniqueness.   newlinechar  newlinechar **tl;dr** Two legs = good, four legs = bad.

I was actually the second person they came to after their first dev bailed on them.  newlinechar  newlinechar They sent me what they had, which they claimed was almost finished and was just lacking a couple of features. They wouldn't tell me how much they'd paid for the code. newlinechar  newlinechar It was several hundred files of HTML mixed with procedural php code, none of which included a single function definition (the only function calls were for PHP library ones like the sql and array manipulation stuff) it also didn't validate any incoming data.. or even check that incoming data existed, just assumed all forms were filled in perfectly.  newlinechar  newlinechar All the database connect and session code was copied/pasted into every page separately rather than being included from one file so they could be easily changed. Bizarrely, he had used an include, but only for the html header and navigation which never changed.. oh yes.. and the navigation was dynamically generated, using 12 database queries per page. newlinechar  newlinechar I went through maybe a hundred of those files closely, NOTHING was salvageable. I had to break the news that they were probably better off starting from scratch.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sadly I was under a NDA on it at the time and had to delete the code after I'd looked at it, it could have made an entire year of DailyWTFs I'm sure. newlinechar  newlinechar

It's been a long time since I was given that cautionary tale, but if I remember correctly, my parents said something to the effect of: 'wait thirty minutes to go swimming after you eat or you'll likely get a cramp'. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I'm not a scientist, but I did play a lot of sports growing up, and in my experience eating a meal and then doing some serious exercising was always pretty uncomfortable.  I realize the eating before swimming tale is obviously fake (or at least the consequences are exaggerated often), but, it isn't a bad idea in my opinion to give your body a little while to digest everything properly before you go running around. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The fan thing is just...really silly.

That is insane. And I did realize that, but my point was that methamphetamine has become a hype-scare in the US. We don't have that in Europe and that's why it's easier to see this from a more objective perspective.
The behavior of everyone in the thread was unacceptable.  It's interesting you bring up mom and arrests, however - you know how hard it is to get arrested for talking dirty to kids when there aren't any kids around?  It's pretty tough.

I would say that **many** people are swayed into the general crowd's way of acting and arguing.

My company translated a Canadian anti-depression drug study for the elderly in which both the placebo group and the drug group both had a very high recovery response (~70% for placebo and for drug).  newlinechar   newlinechar The reason given in the study for the great recovery response in both groups is that the minimal contact between the elderly and the nurses/doctors asking about how they feel, etc. was enough person to person stimulation for these people that it relieved their depression.  newlinechar   newlinechar That was the most depressing thing I read this year. 
Man, I ran into far too many of the folks who thought it was a daily occurrence. Apparently in some areas of Europe (please don't ask me where, I don't know) people have made some dams of sorts at the tops of waterfalls to harness water flow. They 'turn off' the waterfalls when they aren't doing whatever it is they do to capture all that energy. I did notice that a lot of the people asking about the shutoff were from Europe. newlinechar  newlinechar If the people asking about when they get shut off were really asking what time of year they dry up... sheesh. Talk about poor word choice. I suppose I could have noticed what they were really asking and been informative instead of thinking that they were general dumbasses though. ;) newlinechar  newlinechar My favorite story is of a woman who reported a coyote sighting to a friend of mine. When my friend congratulated the woman on getting to see some wildlife the woman asked, 'Well, aren't you going to do something about it?' to which my friend replied, 'What do you mean?' The woman then said, 'Shouldn't it be in it's cage?!'
Overseas, I was directly ordered on multiple occasions to attend protestant religious ceremonies on the grounds that 'everyone in the platoon is attending, no exceptions'.

I just hate cheesy country music, and goddamn if her music is anything more than that.  If you like country music, awesome for you, but her songs are not ground breaking in any fashion.  Bands like Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear are doing brilliant melodic layering and vocal harmonies that are picking up the slack where Brian Wilson left off, and you'd never know they existed from watching the Grammys.  Instead, they prefer to reward another tired country songwriter with the same ideas and execution of a thousand other musicians.  Why reward mediocrity when there is so much fantastic musical innovation and risk taking occurring all the time?

You are really putting too much stock in a single website.  I have read that site and have found errors.  That isn't the point of this discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar It was actually a conversation with you that pointed me to the AR4 summary at wikipedia, which is much easier reading than the actual report.  It is astounding how tame it is compared to alarmists' claims.  Further, some of the most catastrophic claims of AR4 (Himalayan glaciers, Amazon deforestation, etc.) have now been shown to lack scientific vetting. newlinechar  newlinechar I think there is an issue of definitions here.

It was never about Bin Laden, Bush made that clear a few months after the invasion. Even if it was, it's not legal to invade a country in order to extradite a criminal. Even if it were legal, there's still a statute judicial that would have to be followed. Before you judge someone, you need evidence. The US government never provided any evidence. For obvious reasons. First, there probably are none. Chances are the people who masterminded 9/11 have killed themselves. Second, how can a guy sitting in a cave plan such an intrigued scheme.  newlinechar  newlinechar But lets assume it was Bin Laden, which I think it probably was, you have to ask another judicial question: motive of the crime. And that's a jar of worms the US government would never want to open, as it follows further questions about ourselves that we *really* don't want answered.  newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck Bush.

Yea, I don't think Jim Davis ever, for even a split second, worried about something like 'artistic integrity.'  He set out to make money and did.

None of this has anything to do with the OP or what we have been discussing. You are having a discussion with yourself.

I disagree, they do not produce billions in profit for their firm.  The projects/investments/whatever else they selected generate billions in value for the firm, which translates to profit. Everything in any economy ultimately has to have a basis in something of real value (resources, refinement, physical products, time, etc.). newlinechar  newlinechar At best, they chose Project A over Project B, and likely used their connections and power to push through deals.  I can understand the mechanism by which they can claim such vast amounts of money (they deal in power and control), but to claim they actually contribute something of real value equal to their compensation seems dishonest.   newlinechar  newlinechar What I disagree with is the idea that this is their actual market value.  If anything, they hold the system hostage through a network of implicit arrangements with other high-ups ('If I leave here, I take the Exxon, Walmart, and Coca Cola contacts and contracts with me').  They have reached the point where they can define their own 'market value' through what amounts to blackmail.  They are accountable to noone, and are only limited (in the short term) by the quarterly profit-margins of the company (not by any shareholders' feelings or 'markets').

Exactly so. newlinechar  newlinechar The last decades have seemingly shown engineers are necessary but that's only because we eliminated them and didn't see an instantaneous bad effect (or only effects we felt comfortable ignoring).  The damage is more insidious and long lasting.   newlinechar  newlinechar The primary loss is the loss of tacit engineering knowledge: most of what you need to be an engineer can not be taught in universities or out of textbooks.  Much (and it's a lot) is, but not most.  We have been losing such tacit knowledge for decades as we eliminate the primary economic reasons for maintaining it, namely manufacturing.   newlinechar  newlinechar This will come to a head (and in many field I work in, has already hit the fan) when the only engineers who still hold that torch of knowledge retire, die or quit the profession.  Three areas already under threat are: magnetic electromagnet design, analog circuit design and large volume machining and design.  I routinely have to deal with the fact that these are rare in the US as talent areas and most who know anything are well over 50-60 years old with no one at all in apprenticeship (formally or informally) to pass the baton to. newlinechar  newlinechar Could the US rebuild it's capacity?  Sure, but that has a time-constant of 20-30 years and requires capital investment *the whole time before you see any return*, just like disruptive technology R&amp;D - not an accident.  Between Peak Oil and Peak Capital, that'll be a hard nut to crack given US values today and business' short-term financial myopia. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly if Obama were to announce that NASA's recent shutdown is simply a prelude to a focus on a Solar Power Satellite project to entirely replace our oil/gas dependency, then I'd start to think the US had better than a 50-50 chance of pulling out of current economic decline.

Ah cool.  I think the thing to remember is it's not [pardon the expression] white or black.  Being totally blindsided to racial/ethnic stereotypes is just as bad as totally believing they apply to all situations. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if I see a black person on the street I'm not going to jump to 'he's a criminal' but if I'm alone and in a neighbourhood I'm not familiar with and I see a group of teens [white too not just black mind you] I might think 'keep an eye on them.'  It's not unhealthy to fear things you don't know/understand.  If we didn't recoil from animals we don't know for example we'd fall prey to all sorts of nasty things.  It really becomes a problem when you act on it though and the fears are not justified. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm glad you were able to approach the things that made you uncomfortable and move past it.  Kudos! newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, it's not blacks you should fear, it's liberal hippies... :-) j/k

Personally, I find those comments worse than the occasional troll. If you don't believe something is true, prove it or ignore it.
Yet the Champions League usually ends up with a couple of EPL clubs in the semis. The difference is that the EPL clubs have much tighter defenses and they shut down opponents in midfield more quickly. It's easy to look good when you are given space to create. Man Utd looked so good vs. Arsenal because Arsenal didn't show up in midfield and because, on the break with Arsenal committed forward to try to equalize, they had more space than usual. Arsenal's finishing was also terrible (missing Van Persie badly) and had they scored earlier it probably would have been a much tighter game.

I never encountered an undercover cop. They do have forest rangers, or who ever is responsible for policing federal lands. The drive around in pick ups. Very nice. newlinechar   newlinechar At one camp I was involved in a beer chugging competition. Actually it was more like the olympics of beer chugging. There was a little box and each contestant was given a forty and had to go at it while everyone cheered and watch. Well about 15 minutes into this a TINY little girl was up next. She got up on the box and raised the forty to her lips. Right then a state park pickup stopped right in front of the camp. We all grew quiet because no one thought this girl was 21. All eyes were on the cop. A slow smile creeped across the face as if laughing that such a tiny girl could chug a forty. We all cheered and she pounded that fucker down! The cop held a golden plastic cop badge out his truck window, and she stumbled over to claim her prize.  newlinechar Yeah the cops are pretty cool.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: In retrospect that story seems fake. While I may have been drunk when it happened, I definitely remember a beer chugging contest, a tiny girl, and a cop giving her a golden police badge.

The MMO publisher should be pushing updates to Steam periodically so that new Steam users don't have to download 10GB of old crap and then have the game itself update you to current, downloading another 5GB.

Then why have a downvote button at all?  When it comes to links, reddit is designed to bring the stuff most interesting to the biggest group up to the top.  I actually use my hide button far more than anything else, but if I see something I think is stupid, I'll downvote because *that's the point of the arrow*.  I'm casting my vote. newlinechar  newlinechar Khiva is simply complaining that it seems a bit ridiculous that so many grown adults are so excited about pictures of narwhals and bacon, and I tend to agree.

It's the same kind of mentality and maturity level.  I honestly really miss the days when reddit's front page was full of interesting stuff.  Redditors have become so enamored with the reddit site itself and the community (which I do love in many ways) that it's becoming a feedback loop.
Well the diffuser isn't apart of the chassis tub - it can be changed in case of damage etc. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the difficulty stems from it needing to be an integral part of the overall design.

It was 'evolution is a complex theory' that troubled me. Evolution is a _process_ that species undergo over time, and this process is something we have encountered and studied. It exists independently of any theory, it went on for billions of years before Darwin, and will likely continue for many long years more. Darwin's theory of evolution explains this process in terms of natural selection operating on variations within the breed, and favouring those best suited to their environment. newlinechar  newlinechar It's as if you'd said 'gravity is a theory...' - no. Gravity is a force that operates between any two massive objects, it's something we observe. Theories of gravity describe this force mathematically. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's important in this kind of context to distinguish between the observed fact of evolution, and the theory of natural selection that explains it.

It is still relevant as the dispute has not reached a resolution due to foreign intervention. It is at a stalemate just like N and S Korea. China wants it back, and Chiang wanted China proper back even up to the 1970s. Regarding the passing of time, China still is offended whenever people visit that Japanese war shrine.

The Southern delegate in Paris, John Slidell, made offers to Napoléon III : in exchange for a recognition of the Confederate States and naval help sent in New Orleans to break the blockade, the Confederacy would sell raw cotton to France.

Real economy is not game of getting what you paid for. Effects spread around. It's not not zero sum game either. If someone loses, everybody loses directly or indirectly. If someone is doing well, it helps others.

Other countries can expect immigration, increase in crime etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar The price that is worth paying should be calculated carefully. If possible there should be no rescue.

IMHO, newcomers should be introduced Pali/Tipitaka study for several reasons: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) accessibility - because it gives them access to the teachings.  translated materials are far and few.  well translated materials are even more rare. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) reduce effects of 'lost in translation' - no matter how good the translator, translations are always compromised by conscious or unconscious decision of translator. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Dhamma study in Pali is for everyone.  Granted...Pali is a barrier and inconvenient for some people.  But Pali study in Theravada countries is not just for scholars and elites.  Everyone is encouraged to take up some form of Pali/Tipitaka study.  For most people, it may not be much beyond one or two sutta.  So it's possible in the West, also. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) learn Pali for unvarnished transmission Dhamma -   newlinechar Unfortunately, Buddha didn't teach us in English.  The language he used was Pali.  So that's why we ought to know the original Pali.  For the teacher, Dhamma in Pali the basis for teaching.  If one only taught one's own interpretation or translation, or another person's translation, how confident can the teacher be in not varnishing the Dhamma, consciously or unconsciously? newlinechar  newlinechar Buddha taught in Kalama Sutta: Don't just believe what someone taught, even Buddha.  Examine the teachings and its results for yourself.  A good teaching that one ought to take up is one that brings happiness, prosperity, blessings on one's self, family, and community. newlinechar  newlinechar Learning Pali and practicing the teachings is part of the examination process. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) learn Pali as life-long aspiration, part of a cultural practice - newlinechar Buddhism is not just a philosophy and scholarly endeavor.  It's also putting the teachings into practice, discussing with others, mastering the teachings and practices, and teaching others. newlinechar  newlinechar If you can: visit a temple, spend time in the community, visit people in their homes...

Why do Buddhists greet each other by bowing and saluting (bringing palm of hands together)?

http://market-ticker.org/archives/1922-Toyota-Cars-See,-I-Told-You-So.html newlinechar  newlinechar Later reports alleged that inspection of the vehicle showed that the brakes were destroyed - that is, the driver attempted to stop and the brakes overheated to destruction. newlinechar  newlinechar This sort of problem is exacerbated in modern cars without traditional ignition switches and/or electronic transmission controls.  The two 'traditional' ways of dealing with a runaway like this (and which was in fact covered back in my youth when I took driver's education) are to either turn off the ignition (one click only so you don't accidentally lock the steering column!) or shift to neutral.  The former disables power steering so you may find it more difficult to steer to a safe place while the latter may be impossible with an electronically-controlled transmission (it may deny the shift under load irrespective of your command in an attempt to protect the transmission from destruction.)  Shutting off an electronic ignition is difficult in a panic situation as electronic ignition switches require that you press and hold them for several seconds to command a shutdown when the car is in gear - not exactly something you're going to find easy to do when the gas pedal is mashed to the floor and you're trying to avoid collisions! newlinechar  newlinechar But not all cars can 'run away' in this fashion, and it can be argued that none should.  Indeed, it can be argued that that any vehicle with a drive-by-wire system MUST have a means of intuitively overriding an 'un-commanded' acceleration in order to be considered reasonably safe and thus able to be certified for sale. newlinechar  newlinechar Guess what: Some cars with 'drive-by-wire' throttles do have such a safety override. newlinechar  newlinechar VWs (I own a diesel Jetta) are indeed set up to prevent this sort of event from happening.  If you press BOTH the gas pedal and brake on a VW the brake 'wins' - the ECU (engine computer) sees the brake switch is 'on' and reduces the engine to idle even if you are stomping the gas pedal - or it is stuck - at the same time. newlinechar  newlinechar This safety function has to be able to be overridden, especially in manual transmission vehicles, in order to be able to reasonably launch on an incline - or if there's a failure in the brake switch (lest the vehicle become immediately un-drivable.)  VWs include that - it's documented in the owner's manual and ALSO quite intuitive - if you press the accelerator while the brake is applied the engine will not rev, but if you 'double tap' the accelerator pedal the safety measure is overridden for the moment and you can accelerate as required.  If the brake switch sticks on you can still drive the car - you do, however, have to 'double tap' the gas pedal to command acceleration in this circumstance.

&gt; It seems that so much of John's gospel is like this - these little details thrown in that would otherwise normally escape the narrative. newlinechar  newlinechar I never noticed this line before... John writes, 'it was about the tenth hour.'   newlinechar  newlinechar 'About the *ninth* hour' would be a normal way to say 'mid-afternoon' (i.e. ~3pm).

I'm saying we've obviated all the natural barriers to unchecked population growth- predation, killing off our food, geographical limitations, disease. So we need to instill some artificial ones. We need to make the big leap to being a conscious species.
They gave you clues already, didn't they?  newlinechar  newlinechar So, WHY would you feel attracted to females? What in particular is it, that makes you attracted to a certain female?

Otherwise you would be gay already. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck!
Oh bull shit. Holyphuck's assumptions are small. Find someone else that follows the 'lemmings' of Reddit in reality.

I spent years working in kitchens, I know how to manually handle garlic. I'm not advocating the press because of lack of skills, I'm advocating it for the vast increase in speed.  newlinechar  newlinechar My point was that I can drop two cloves in the press and crush them into a pan inside of five seconds, push the cleaner in and rinse the press clean in about another five, and not have gotten my hands all garlicked up... and finish whatever it is that I'm cooking. It's about the time saved, for me. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not right for all uses, but for sauces, soups, and anything else with a liquid/oil carrier, it works wonders in an instant.

It should honestly be our duty to spare these people the same brunt and save their innocence.

I've actually heard that from a lot of my teacher friends...unfortunately, from what I hear, there are too many teachers who don't try to understand the kids and just bitch about them rather than trying to relate to them more...course, my friends are younger, so it's probably still easier for them to understand high schoolers.

Abortion is legal to save the life of the mother in the Philippines (which is consistent with her story), under the constitutional requirement to protect the life of the mother and child equally.  No hospital staff has been prosecuted for performing an abortion in these circumstances.  However, I don't know the details of the conversation between this woman and her doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar If the doctor recommended an abortion that would be illegal in the Philippines, he would probably recommend a hospital outside the Philippines.
I've seen that on Eclipse.  It can put some extra characters way out in right field.  But I haven't seen it anywhere else.
I don't think he said there wasn't?  Point is that tryptophan doesn't exert that effect directly. newlinechar  newlinechar tryptophan -&gt; 5-hydroxytryptophan -&gt; 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) -&gt; N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine -&gt; 5-hydroxy-N-acetyltryptamine (melatonin) newlinechar  newlinechar Melatonin *does* make you sleepy, but the process of converting tryptophan into melatonin is by no means instantaneous and is strongly rate-limited by the paucity of certain enzymes (tryptophan hydroxylase being the main one).  Melatonin production is also favored by low levels of blue-wavelength light.  People tend to eat Thanksgiving dinner when it's dark out and so would probably be getting fairly tired at about the same time even if they abstained from eating. newlinechar  newlinechar Tryptophan can also be converted into the NMDA receptor antagonist, kynurenine, which is a psychotomimetic and hypnotic.  For comparison, ketamine is also an NMDA antagonist. newlinechar  newlinechar There's actually a number of amino acids in meat that could conceivably induce sleepiness.  I have no idea where people got the idea from that it was tryptophan that was responsible.  Then there are amino acids that would promote wakefulness, as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The real reason probably has something to do with insulin or possibly cholecystokinin release triggered by the consumption of food.
If recursion could easily cause a stack overflow it is probably the wrong solution in any case. Recursion should be used where the stack size is going to be bounded by O(log n). A simple example is tree walking.

Cool!  Nice to meet you!  I teach life drawing and I realize that some people, such as graphic design students, are more comfortable with shape.  They typically won't be dealing too much with form, unless they go into packaging, so I might as well try to keep the focus on designing good shapes.  For animation students, I try to get them to focus on understanding form.  For them elegant design seems to come secondary to trying to be accurate.  It's hard to teach when you have two different majors in your class and you could be teaching specifically better if you only had one major to deal with.
Ahh that would make sense. Thanks for clearing that up.

Actually I majored in business.  I was tapped to help in the English department on the strengths of my writing and because I wasn't an English major (they had plenty of those).  I actually thought that my biggest strength there was doing just what you're describing: I'd re-examine the assignment prompt (we saw a lot of students so we had a pretty good idea what professors would except) and see if the student couldn't approach it in a way that was better suited to their skills/interests. I was always telling people to scale it back and go easier on themselves in the research department- you're being graded on your writing- turn in something that isn't ambitious if you have to. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you completely. People can be made literate without making them literary.

The administrating is *increasing* NASA's funding, it's just telling them to fund research instead of a moon shot. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What if the Wright brothers never wanted to go flying because they thought their time was better spent helping at a soup kitchen? newlinechar  newlinechar A more appropriate analogy would be if we tried to fly the Wright Flier across the Atlantic instead of investing in new airplane tech to do the job better, more safely and more efficiently.  Repeating the moon landing at great expense (relative to the other things NASA can do) is essentially eating our seed corn.

All of that is inside the realm of human thought, based on what we have experienced and observed here on this planet.

I think i see what you're saying. Infinite regression could lead us all the way down to some single-cell organism, at the very root of the phylogenetic tree.

You prefer different.. like being a pussy and not doing anything? Awesome. I'm sure that'll get you a girlfriend. And yeah, it IS easy to say, you know why? Because I did it.

Yeah, the first few times are really fucking awkward and is seriously a blow to the already fragile ego. But the more you try, the less it hurts and the easier it is. But it doesn't get easier if you don't fucking try. There's no magical solution to be able to be good with girls. newlinechar  newlinechar But you know what's great about frat boys? They can get girls. Why? Because they're doing something right. Hey, I'm not saying find the love of your life by chucking a frisbee at them. I'm saying find girls to play frisbee with you by chucking a frisbee at them. I mean, you don't even have to throw the frisbee at them, but you kind of sound like a bitch who needs a crutch to start a conversation (I mean you even said it yourself you don't know what to say so how about 'sorry about that frisbee that knocked your friend out. my name's grantrules. maybe you'd like to play a little defense for your remaining conscious friends and join our game?'), so that's a good one.

There's another word in the same vein, *[anaphero,](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G399&amp;t=KJV)* which literally means 'to bear up.' It's used in terms of offering a sacrifice and also as a word for carrying a burden, as an animal carries its load; it also has the connotation of bringing up a person or matter in prayer, which speaks to the *intercessory* role of the Old Testament priesthood. (Important to keep in mind when reading Hebrews.) The central part of the Eucharistic liturgy is called the *anaphora.* newlinechar  newlinechar Depending on the emphasis we bring to passages conatining *airo* and *anaphero*, there are a number of places where the Protestant west reads penal substitution into a passage while the Greek east reads it in terms of Christ's *carrying away* both sins and the pain they cause.

You can't *finish* it, perhaps, but you could start it.

The acting was terrible in G.I. Joe compared to Transformers 2. Not only that, at least Michael Bay went on site for all his shots instead of using CGI for EVERYTHING. Just the fact that people thought this was passable as good for a movie is surprising.

Uh... I'm a psycholinguistics research assistant, so maybe my only bias is in knowing the defined tenants of language. Learning how to reproduce sounds or symbols doesn't demonstrate meaning. There's never been any grammar or understanding of how word order affects meaning in other animals. They haven't learned how to communicate about intangible ideas, the future, events that could or could not occur, etc. Sometimes we find isolated instances of ONE of these (such as communicating future danger) but rarely in combination with even one other thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Language is a lot more than just words. If you'd like, I can link you to some excellent resources on the brain anatomy that makes humans uniquely capable of processing language.
Well the whole point is that the community setting those rights is at the municipal level. Tyrannies of the majority become less likely when you're dealing with less people, and small municipal administrative units allow for ease of transit should you oppose the value system in a given community. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, all majorities are not tyrannical. Also, what you consider your 'rights' are in fact variable. Look at the amendment process of the US constitution. Through it, rights are bestowed and withdrawn. This is an entirely legitimate process.  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, it seems more often than not libertarians advocate anarchism, rather than any system of government based on enlightenment principles of natural rights and the social covenant that necessarily infringes on those rights.

FYI, I learned through an overview of my biological mass transfer class that your intestines need a lot of blood flow to operate.

Well you don't know me but I do not like the Limp Bizkit version at all and it makes me cringe just thinking about it.
Yeah, but that's just human nature.  If most people were green and you were blue, you'd be unpopular.  There were maybe one or two situations where I was asked to pray (or something like that) as part of a group (platoon, company, etc).  When that happened, I just played along.  It was no skin off my back, and it kept me out of the limelight.  Yes, I could have taken a principled stand, but the BS that would have come from that was not worth it imo.  As was pointed out above, you could have gone to IG and gotten the situation rectified, but as you pointed out, in remote areas, things are not that cut-and-dry, and butting heads with your command is not always a good idea.  Still, if anyone asked what I believed in, I told them straight up I was an atheist.  Most of my platoon sergeants and all of my squad leaders knew, and I was never singled out because of it or treated differently in any way.

The Palace of Westminster is nominally exempt because it's a Royal Palace. It's not a Gentleman's Club, and as it happens the whole building's non-smoking anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Gentleman's Clubs are not exempt from the smoking ban thanks to the risiblely ignorant interjection of Caroline Flint during the debate, suggesting that Pubs would simply relable themselves 'Gentleman's Clubs' to avoid the ban, ignoring the fact that doing so would legally preclude them from earning a profit. This moronic contribution to the 'debate' inevitably went unchallenged in the House, because the clownish shower of rank amateurs that serves for a legislature in the UK are of course profoundly ignorant of the Law. Amongst other things. newlinechar  newlinechar TL/DR: You're wrong. And ignorant. But no more so than the shambolic crowd of mouthbreathers in charge.

I'm more interested in the commentary on an article than the article itself (most of the time).  While there are a lot of idiots on reddit, there are also a lot of people who are extremely intelligent or who have first hand knowledge of the subject being discussed.  The commenting system makes most of the good comments rise to the top (as well as a couple of memes), which is a much better system than Digg where the first comments are always the top ones.

Yeah! It's a really fun hobby, but be warned you're best off starting with a kit project as there's a ton to know about cabinetry, electronics, and acoustics before you're set to design your own from scratch.  newlinechar  newlinechar The best value out there is the tritrix kit from part sexpress: http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?Partnumber=300-702 newlinechar  newlinechar It's a full kit (speakers, cabinets, crossover parts - the works) for just $200. They're a floor standing, transmission-line speaker and they sound great - easily as good as speakers at the $1000 level. Once you've built it and have a good idea of how the whole thing works, then you can foray into designing your own from scratch. I recommend perhaps a book such as [speaker building 201](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?Partnumber=300-702) to read up on the basics and et familiar with the lingo. newlinechar  newlinechar My favorite place to hang out is the [parts express forum](http://techtalk.parts-express.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2), lots of friendly and knowledgeable people there and they're always up for helping a noob out :)

A lot of sci-fi books predict private space exploration as well.

However, the supposed leaders in commercial spaceflight, like SpaceX for example, are subsidized by NASA just like the companies that were developing Ares I and V. The only difference is that their projects cost less. But the reason they cost less is not because they are innovating the field by being commercial enterprises, rather, they cost less because they only go barely past the Kármán line whereas the Ares rockets could go to the moon.

You have this romanticized idea about what relations are between males and females.  You've got a little bit of a white knight syndrome here- you think that by refusing to participate in the aggressive behavior that allows most males to procreate, you're actually somehow superior to them. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not superior to them in that regard unless you're more successful in reproduction than they are.  By your own admission, you're not.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think dropping a lot of this attitude and getting more experience with women will go a long way towards changing your perspective.

Do your research. The prayer at the Passover Seder (also at the end of Yom Kippur services) is a prayer for the coming of the Messiah.

&gt;They're not the most sturdy of ocean going vessels are they?  newlinechar  newlinechar No.  They are not meant for the ocean.  They are intended for quiet water like very large lakes.

If you want to move it from one lake to another, you will have to hire a truck to move it which will drive up the cost of ownership considerably.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you have a situation like they have in Louisiana where you can 'buy' a portion of a river/bayou for really cheap money and then build a floating house on the water, that's a different story and is quite cost effective (but the structure does not move -- just floats in one spot).

I don't really follow your logic.

Fair enough: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Nationalism generally involves the identification of an ethnic identity with a state.[1] The subject can include the belief that one's nation is of primary importance.[2] It is also used to describe a movement to establish or protect a homeland (usually an autonomous state) for an ethnic group. In some cases the identification of a homogeneous national culture is combined with a negative view of other races of cultures. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism](Source) newlinechar  newlinechar It never even occurred to me to perceive the notion of nationalism from a non-idealistic angle. I guess that speaks volumes about what kind of nationalists I'm primarily exposed to.

The word nationalism has unpleasant connotations for me, but don't let it bug you - it's a personal taste.

I've followed this reddit for a few days. I've read about the mother who let her kids starve because she felt God would take care of them. I've read about the parents who didn't get their daughter diabetes treatment and instead prayed her to death. I've read about enough cases of religious ideas leading to irrational, yea fatal behavior that I don't think I need to accept your accusation of **pre**judice. newlinechar  newlinechar Next, you're going to tell me that atheists do stupid stuff too. I'll counter that by pointing out that the set of stuff theists are liable to do is exactly the same as what atheists will do, **plus** the stupid stuff only theists do. Then you will drag the argument into a circle by claiming that, since prayer is not harmful it is not stupid; or you'll make a similarly irrelevant argument. At that point, I will give up debating with you any more. newlinechar  newlinechar The end.

Rather than just one score, people have two scores - EP, Effort Points, and GP, Gear Points. You get EP for whatever your raid leader wants to give it for (being on time to raids, outside raid contributions to raid materials, boss kills, bonuses for first kills, etc). You get GP when you get loot. You are ranked based on EP divided by GP.  newlinechar  newlinechar Over time, both EP and GP decay at a rate and frequency to be decided by the guild (my guild is currently running 10% decay per raiding night). The decay doesn't shift any of the balance or ranking of people, but it helps make more recent contributions more important, and helps prevent longer running members from being at a disadvantage due to accumulated GP. Since EP decays, people aren't as prone to hording for a particular item, since they'll in effect lose some EP due to that. Since GP decays, people are rewarded for taking items as soon as they can get them, since the sooner you get the item, the sooner its GP starts decaying. newlinechar  newlinechar One big problem we had that kept ticking people off was that people who were being inconsistent in their schedule were also hoarding DKP and taking top end items, then rarely showing up to use them. That's one of the reasons why a system with decay appealed to us so much - it much more strongly rewards those who are consistently in attendance. In the past, we had tried running zero sum with various modifications to offset this (such as double DKP earned for guild first kills), but it really screwed up the zero sum system. Since we switched to EPGP, we've had a fraction of the loot problems we used to have.

The reason the myth persists is because even though the FAA admits that Bernoulli's principle isn't the correct explanation, they accept it as a simplified explanation.

I was wondering why the crickets were chirping so loudly.  newlinechar  newlinechar Regarding S3, it's tough to say how much money I'm saving.  I host everything with a local company  named Swiftco, and when my site started to get a ton of traffic in November I got a bill from them for around $1100 in bandwidth overages.  I've since switched to s3 and my hosting is somewhere between $1800 - $2400 / month, but I get a ton more traffic now than I did then, so it's tough to compare.  I know that setup was really easy and it even works with [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/TRANSMIT/), so I never had to write a single line of code.  newlinechar  newlinechar One major problem I'm having with S3 though is that anyone can hotlink my images and I can't set up a rewrite rule to block those, so I'm getting billed every month for hotlinkers. I tried setting it up in lighttpd so that the images are internally rewritten to s3 - meaning they appear to be hosted  on theoatmeal.com, but are actually being served out of s3, but I couldn't get it to work.  Instead, the images are redirected.  For example, if you visit [this page](http://theoatmeal.com/img/comics/customer_service/kitty_litter_breakfast.png) you'll be redirected over to the s3 version of that URL.

Just to note: that quote was referencing a constant tax (everyone pays the same *amount*, not *rate*), so I still believe that statement holds. I was not yet talking about a proportional or ('flat' rate) tax. newlinechar  newlinechar However, further on I was arguing against a proportional tax based on the flawed belief that even a constant utility tax couldn't be approximated by a proportional tax on money. This flawed belief was amended in edit2. I would argue that a progressive tax on money would be needed if you wanted to have a proportional ('flat') tax on utility, but a proportional ('flat') tax on money may very well be able to approximate a constant tax on utility -- which seems just fine to me. newlinechar  newlinechar To conclude: yes, I was against a proportional tax (including a sales tax), but after realizing a flaw, I now find that it may make sense.

Hmm, I see what you guys are saying, and I am a pretty reasonable person but being from the UK and other countries (China, South Korea and Holland) I can be objective. I think what we in the UK term anti-social behaviour is a very real phenomenon. Not that its exclusive to the UK, but you would be hard pressed to find another westernised country that tolerates the kind of criminal activity we do without actually criminalising it. newlinechar  newlinechar For example: If a group of drunken teenagers decided to smash all of your windows on the way home from a nightclub they had illegally been drinking in, there would be no criminal charges or penalties even if they were caught. It would be deemed 'anti-social' (which it is) and that the kids were just 'having a laugh'. The state (police) would surely know exactly what had just happened but it would never get any further than recording the event for future reference. This actually shows that for all the CCTV and legislation we have,  the UK is extremely liberal and forgiving when it comes to crime, so I don't think its a 'boogeyman' word, rather more an apology for not having the will to criminalise people for their wrong doings but accepting that they are not law abiding in the true sense of the word, by law abiding I mean generally having consideration for other people. This is a somewhat crude and simplified explanation of my opinion.

Glad to help! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Have you made use of the advanced movement shortcuts? They typically end with `-sexp` and were meant for lisp-based languages.

You're right - you don't know how to read this.  Volume is the number of shares traded daily.  Shares outstanding, which you get from the key statistics link, is the number of total shares in existence.  GS has 514 million shares outstanding.   newlinechar  newlinechar 100/514 = ~0.2 newlinechar  newlinechar GS's diluted earnings per share is $22.13.  If GS's CEO didn't get paid squat and GS still performed the same, GS's diluted earnings per share would be $22.33.  That's less than a 1% difference.  If he's doing a good job of maximing GS's profits (and it's pretty clear that GS's profits have been maximized), I think that's a pretty reasonable salary.
Well from what I understand from the interview I was listning too, they had scrapped the Mako (now the Hammerhead) for the main game. This was design decision  from the beginning.

Yeah, we're pretty much on the same page. I lived in a liberal arts college town for a few years and got pretty tired of the 'bow before Zinn and Chomsky' folks I ran into.

No other writings, no interviews until his recent death. One book, which I liked as a springboard for exploring more about history and as an illustration of liberal philosophy.

Access to fluid, robust investment capital can arguably be attributed as having almost single-handedly driven all facets of progress in society. That being said, is that single man responsible for more than $100million in added-value to the economy?  That is literally (in a market context) saying he has added more value than 1000 average engineers. newlinechar  newlinechar Can you attribute the productivity of his investments directly to him?  That seems unfair to the workers and business-people and engineers and whatever that actually thought of, developed and built the company he invested in.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think we place too much value on roles that are in essence glorified plant operators: lubing and watching the machine to make sure it runs smoothly.

&gt;Was there any psychological 'aftermath' about the fact that you shot someone? newlinechar  newlinechar I had some bad dreams after words.

Looking at them I realized that all of them were mexican mafia, the same gang affiliation as the one I shot (he was a lieutenant).

I call people only once per week and leave a message saying 'please return my call by xxxx' newlinechar  newlinechar If they don't get back to me or return my calls, I will hand the file over to a 3rd party who will 'Harass the fuck' out of you. newlinechar  newlinechar If it's gotten to the point like you say, your friend probably has not been cooperative with his lender. I am much happier when people take a proactive approach and keep me informed of their situations - there are a lot of temporary solutions, payment reduction etc. that can be used to help someone who owes you money until they get back on their feet.
Vampire dust is a key ingredient of most hair products, although for a few obvious reasons the companies like to keep quiet about it. The substance actually improves your hair, with a noticeable sheen lasting up to 24 hours.
yes I was put off for a second but I figured maybe someone just colored in the glasses in the wanted poster - a little vandalism isn't enough to stop my highly trained observation eye.
Not me!
It's annoying that people still believe that Macs are on some other plane of existence, even modern macs. I'm glad I'm not crazy.
ISSS OVVVEEERRRPRRRICCCEEEDDD BUUUDDD LIGGGHTTTT!!
Alternatively, the overseer could instead be the pharaoh, talking in second person (like 'Bob Dole doesn't need this!').
Oh no! He's trapped somewhere and he's sending us a coded SOS!
Just beat it a second time as well (high five!) and explored all the systems this time with my loyal-to-Liara imported Paragon Shepard (cheesy I know, I totally went for Miranda the first time though). I was happy that I only found out that I still had my save after going through the game a first time, 'cause I lost a few people at the end. Can't wait for ME3. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I'm wondering if I should restart one more time with a Renegade female, play ME1 again (to refresh the story), or resume my normal life :/...
Newspapers existed before governments subsidized them, and they would continue to exist so long as there were sufficient demand. You lack imagination if you believe that something funded by government could only exist because of that funding. newlinechar  newlinechar Would we not have corn if it weren't for government? How about housing? 
I wouldn't call him a moron. He did try hard for the first few months then dabbled for the rest of year, he just didn't have the drive to learn guitar it was easier to game on his playstation then attempting to learn music. newlinechar  newlinechar About him spending lots of money (you do realize that even on a beginner's guitar your looking at a minimum of $300 for something cheap)  on the guitar and other equipment. He spent that much (roughly) because he listened to a actual guitar player. The guitar player assured him that you needed good equipment or else it would sound really shitty, so he bought a epiphone les paul, fender amp, couple of pedals and a few books, that almost game to $1500. I dont blame him for spending that money i blame the guitar playing dude for making my buddy think he needed pretty good equipment to start out.
For some reasons, my brother and I would call it 'dexter' when we were little kids. 
&gt;You'd think the statewide subreddit would have more subscribers than any given city... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Austin has a shit-ton of redditors, with so much tech industry here, and I think a lot of us feel more community/cultural pride in the city than we feel commonality with the rest of the state.  Also, there are a lot of Austinites who've never really even *been* to other parts of TX, after moving here for UT or work.
I think part of this misconception might be that *visible* light does not pass through the skull (as far as I know?), but other forms of light (i.e. other parts of the spectrum -- UV, for example) could potentially pass through the solid matter of your flesh, muscle and bones. newlinechar  newlinechar I could be wrong, though.
Hmm, I see your point now.  Sorry for being a little rude above. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, I can imagine the jokes that would take place today if tasers were used instead of clubs.
