It isn't my personal life, it is the enormity of the crimes I hear about.  I agree with all your above points, with these qualifications: standards of living have gone up for some people, not all. Literacy rates have gone up because there are more people in the 'pool'. Do your stats take into account the huge increase in population we have had? Slaves were freed a long time ago, yet we barely pay illegals to do the grunt work now. And women can still vote. Actually my personal life is fine, thanks.  I just got a fairly large raise, I am reasonably happy with life, but I think we ALL need to look around us.  We need to come up for air, and see who is floating next to us.  Not everyone is doing as well as I am.  That is sad to me. There will always be a bell-shaped curve in life, but it's getting a little pointy at the top instead of round.

**tldr; School is boring and it needs to be fixed by making it relevant to our daily lives** newlinechar  newlinechar Hijacking an upper comment here--  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I'd like to say the education system is to blame, but the reality of it is that people in the US have never really valued education. newlinechar We did. A long time ago. Back when it was relevant. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; We deride people who are academically-inclined or educated, we praise the 'self-made man' who made something of himself without the need for formal training, we call them nerds, book-worms. newlinechar My belief is that the anti-intellectualism stems from people not being entertained by what intellectuals think is 'cool' -- like programming. They associate intellectuals with Shakespeare and Monet and wine tastings. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe that part of the reason the self-made man is respected is because they have skills that are relevant -now- and can make a difference... -now-. newlinechar  newlinechar To understand how we got to this point, I need to give a small history lesson. Back in the 1800s, when the American education system was first sprouting up, the most PRESTIGIOUS career you could possibly have is a priest. That's why you went to school. No other reason why anyone would go to school. That's why you went to college. Actually, that's why most old-old colleges have a religious affiliation. Now, back then the only thing that was important to analyze was the Bible.  newlinechar  newlinechar And that was fine. If you wanted to become a priest. Then capitalism came in. Started saying, 'Hey, school/college is for everyone. So we're not just having you study the Bible, we're having you study Shakespeare too.' and that was fine. For the 1700s. When there were no cars and no railroads, and generally no reason to learn problem solving, engineering, marketing, sales, or writing. newlinechar  newlinechar While I love Shakespeare's writing and Claude Monet's painting, we should absolutely not be forcing that crap on our kids, masquerading it as 'teaching analytical skills'. What's more important? Learning to analyze Shakespeare, or learning to analyze modern social problems. Yes, I know, Shakespeare has some applications to modern social problems, no, I don't care. We've tried doing this shit the Shakespeare way since the 1700s. What's it done to the spirit and motivation of our students? It's crushed it. DOE performance audits (both internal and public) rate student motivation as it's lowest... ever. newlinechar  newlinechar My boss' original question is-- well, why is that? Here's the answer, and I'm right about this: it's because the stuff our students are learning is no longer relevant to their daily lives. At all. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's something I learned the other day that simply blew me away-- one of my favorite Counter-Strike maps was, in fact, built by a fourteen year old. This kid apparently taught himself how to use it using online tutorials, and then practiced and practiced until something good came out.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you can get a fourteen year-old kid to teach himself how to create a complicated map, while studying how gameplay flows inbetween the different areas, and successfully marketing it to a community, why isn't that kid being taught to do that in school? The CS thing is a perfect example, because it teaches marketing, analytics, critical thinking skills... all REALLY important. Yes, Shakespeare teaches critical thinking skills. I know. I don't care. Shakespeare is boring to *most* 14 year-old kids. CS is not. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, we don't value education, we don't value culture, we rejected everything the 'old world' taught us  newlinechar Yep. But screw the old world. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; threw the baby out with the bath-water, so now all we have left is an obscene culture of self-indulgence, self-gratification and self-obsession. newlinechar Yeah, pretty much hit the nail on the head. We need the education system fixed. newlinechar  newlinechar My first paying job was a Senate policy analyst. I specialized in education.

http://www.crazyblinddate.com/ newlinechar  newlinechar OKCupid, like most of the other sites, is a good way to just get out and meet new people without it being a bar.  Historically I've not been a dating man, more looking for relationships, and I've always found those via communities I was involved with (clubs in school, online gaming, etc), but my friends who do more dating say to pretty much treat things like OKCupid like a bar.  Have fun, be open minded, be relaxed, have a good date and you'll be fine.  Just like a bar, everyone puts their best foot forward on these sites, and so should you.  Just like a bar, sometimes you'll approach someone (online) and they'll turn you down.  But at least the size of the pool is a bit larger and you know more about them, so you'll have more initial success.  Like you, I dig OKCupids look/feel/philosophy more than others, but the quality of people is not necessarily better. newlinechar  newlinechar Manage your expectations and have some fun, and they're a fine place to meet new people.  99% of all people are average, and that's true on these sites too :)

&gt; Well sorry dude, I think its pretty clear that I am not anything even close to being a nutritionist.

(Also: *Dudette).   newlinechar    newlinechar &gt;I even said that if you know of one to let me know, I said I personally had never heard of a diet that included this.   newlinechar    newlinechar You can incorporate most anything into a diet, given proper planning and structure. Not too difficult. Since you're a newb, you should know now that most foods aren't 'taboo,' so much as portion control, eating frequency, etc. are really top consideration. If you want to eat three slice of bread with Nutalla, wolf it down (with a protein shake) post-workout (say, hard full-body lift and some cardio). Voila! Incorporation indeed.   newlinechar    newlinechar &gt;How is my post stupid?    newlinechar    newlinechar Your post is stupid (i.e., betraying a lack of knowledge and/or understand) because of the displayed incredulity at eating bread + Nutella.    newlinechar    newlinechar &gt;I think you need to improve your reading comprehension skills and rethink what you're saying before you type it. newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar I read  and understood (and responded to) your comment just fine. Perhaps *you* are in need of adjusting reading comprehension and response?   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;BTW I live in Argentina, only been to Miami once and NYC twice. I think NYC is overrated to be honest, bunch of lights and expensive stuff. I don't know what the general American diet consists of, just that there is a problem with obesity in that country and it probably includes McDonalds.   newlinechar    newlinechar I have never been to Argentina. Good on you for visiting America, though I'm not certain I'd classify Miami as the cultural epicetner of the 'States. I love New York City, but maybe I'm just biased. The 'McDonald's' rhetoric is pretty bullshit, the Western diet as a collective entity is quite detrimental and non-nutritious; not just limited to fast food places. The grocery store itself is dismal. But I'd imagine you don't have to deal with that where you live?

Although your asset allocation seems pretty well diversified and highly adaptive, I wonder what your Sharpe ratios are looking like. I know you're going for yield, but I'd like to see how your portfolio stacks up against the market line.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I think you can play the market a little with a little help from FF3. For instance, you've segmented the market intuitively, which implies differentiation, so what about their betas? Obviously trolls are going to produce high volatility, but let's also consider high covariance with being new users and with helpful posters (probably highly attractive troll-targets). Now you see that you can get some meaningful betas out of constructing your own variables and regressing the market on them. newlinechar  newlinechar This also indicates that around 45% of your portfolio is subjected to more idiosyncratic risk than you thought (5% trolls plus 20% + 20% helpful posters with high covariance). I would really want to see what kind of loadings yield meaningful betas, then do asset allocation based on them.

One of the reasons I've never even tried drugs is that I know when buying the stuff, I'd have to support organized crime.  By definition.  It wouldn't necessarily have to be large-scale organized crime, because supposedly you can get locally-grown weed that comes from relatively reputable people, but it's hard to know for sure.  I know that not far from here, across the border in Mexico, there's a ton of drug-related violence, and I know that *some* weed comes from Mexico, and I feel like if I bought drugs, I couldn't be sure whether I was contributing to that or not.  So I find it simpler just to avoid them. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, a few things: newlinechar  newlinechar * This is not an inherent property of the drugs.  I'm not saying it's necessarily morally wrong to use drugs.  I'm just saying that it *might* be morally questionable given the status quo, where drugs often come via organized crime. newlinechar * I'm not saying people who use drugs should be put in jail.  I don't think they should.  I think it's pretty damned wasteful and pointless, actually. newlinechar  newlinechar My point is, drug users are largely innocent, but I'm not sure they're absolutely, 100% free of some tinge of moral culpability.  They know the situation, which is that there is some risk that they're enriching a corrupt, violent organization.  They didn't set it up that way, but that's how it is regardless. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: rephrased stuff minorly to make it clearer

Seems like most atheists at some point wish they could just take the blue pill and be happy with some kind of fairy tale religion. But as you describe, you can't unknow what you know, so it wouldn't really work. My own world view could be considered spiritual despite my atheism, which is probably why I feel uncomfortable with the term. I like to read the [Tao Te Ching](http://www.taoteching.org/) and think I might be understanding something. newlinechar  newlinechar There's a [commencement speech](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178211966454607.html) I read recently that you might find interesting. It's by David Foster Wallace, of whom I had never heard before.  newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, here's a nice passage from another translation of the [Tao Te Ching](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a newlinechar full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem newlinechar listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of newlinechar their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look newlinechar dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of newlinechar men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost newlinechar everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of newlinechar chaos. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be newlinechar benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull newlinechar and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as newlinechar if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while newlinechar I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone newlinechar am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao). newlinechar

Although you're not totally off-base, it is incorrect to say that 'no one' can tell you what being American means. America, as a nation of immigrants, must look not to ethnicity or shared culture to find it's foundation, but values. Those who are particularly conservative and have a problem with using the word 'values' in this context may replace it with universal truths.  newlinechar  newlinechar The way in which we 'value' the varying universal truths differ, but a vast majority of the country does indeed hold to these truths. Liberty, equality, democracy, justice, these are what America must base itself off of for lack of a common ethnicity. Even your statement of saying we're too individualistic comes back to this point, our individualism is a result of these shared truths, and our individualism itself results in the varying degrees of values we place on the universal truths, or in rare cases the outright rejection of said truths/values.

Waking Life was not a philosophy lecture: it was a movie *about people having philosophies*, just like Slacker was.  Those who always try to pick these films apart for being pretentious always miss the bus on this one - Linklater's critics, are, themselves, the kind of people he likes to feature in his films - the kind of people he is amused by.  Undoubtedly he has his ideas on the world, but his focus here is the novelty of people, and how they think.  Too many of the characters have contradictory ideas or personalities to make any conclusion on ideas Linklater himself holds or is trying to push - which does, in fact, make me think people don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're on reddit, and you read subreddits based on ideas (religion, politics, philosophy, economics), you, yourself, might as well be a character in Linklater's dreams. newlinechar  newlinechar This is my relationship to the Internet as a whole:  Those who have philosophies and ideas on life are generally far more interesting than the actual belief systems they advocate.  I sit here in front of this monitor every day looking for interesting people expressing interesting ideas.  How I feel about the ideas or opinions is secondary to how I will feel about the person holding them. newlinechar  newlinechar And this is why I like Linklater, and why I like Waking Life.  But hey, whatever -- more for me.

Yep.  This ties into Whedon's status as 'nice guy,' who presents the kind, gentle vision of the patriarchy saving and protecting women.  He makes sure there's always a super macho character to act as a foil, too, so that kinder, gentler patriarchy is seen as a viable alternative.  The beautiful, gentle, barefoot brunette is the vision of an ideal woman shared by 'nice guys' everywhere: wayward, in need of fixing, frail.  The ass-kickery that Whedon's women sometimes engage in is consistently, without fail, used to further emphasize their later vulnerability.

Knowing Apple products, the tablet will be *nearly* ideal for casual use at home... but it will then be completely crippled by a 'helpful feature' that you can't turn off. newlinechar  newlinechar For example: newlinechar  newlinechar iPhone - the tilt sensor cannot be disabled. Changing tracks while walking is impossible because coverflow keeps activating; Safari is completely crippled for browsing while you're lying down on your side. No indicator LED light, so you can't see if you've got voicemail unless you turn the phone on. newlinechar  newlinechar AppleTV - a software power switch means the fucking thing won't stay turned off unless it's unplugged. newlinechar  newlinechar I can almost guarantee that those utter fucktards at Apple think they know best and are going to slip in a couple of infuriating 'features' like that in the tablet. newlinechar  newlinechar So my 'worst-case' prediction the iTablet is: newlinechar  newlinechar * It'll have an unkillable tilt sensor. newlinechar * Won't read non-DRM'ed eBooks. newlinechar * Requires a wireless data plan or MobileMe subscription. newlinechar * The metal body is slippery and hard to hold. newlinechar * Shitty battery life with no power switch. newlinechar * No indicator LED light. newlinechar * Back-mounted camera, no microphone (no videophone for you!) newlinechar * Does not sync to a desktop over WiFi. newlinechar * No wireless power (like the Palm Pre) - and a new dock connector to mess with instead. newlinechar * Bad screen: fingerprint magnet / cannot be viewed in direct sunlight. newlinechar * Would work better with a stylus, but uses finger touch anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar If Apple gets their shit together - it could be awesome. But I'm taking a 'wait and see' attitude because given how terrible the AppleTV is, I'm almost convinced that their success with the iPhone was a fluke.

Having lived in Santa Cruz during the time you were doing all that, I had thought (and still do now) that the homeless population was a direct result of ill-conceived altruism on the part of the Santa Cruz population.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The town I was in also helped. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes.

According to her, most of the homeless in SC had no interest in cleaning up.  As you say, the freedom was too intoxicating.

Childhood neglect causes, basically, brain damage.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Think about how children learn about cause-and-effect - they have a need (hunger; discomfort; affection), express that need, and the caregiver responds. The infant or young child is able to easily grasp the relationship between their need, their behavior, and getting a response. As children get older, they learn from their caregivers' responses when to become upset, how upset to become, and how they can begin calming themselves - this is basically teaching them how to express and modulate their emotions.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If a child's caregiver responds to her unpredictably, or not at all, the child either does not learn these lessons, or learns the wrong things. They may have trouble thinking about how their actions affect others, or know how to get the 'right' amount upset, or how to calm themselves, or what to get upset over. They may expect people to ignore them, or hurt them, or punish them, or not do anything unless they seriously overreact. Or they may not even know what they expect.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Disorders that can be associated with childhood neglect include Reactive Attachment Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, various mood disorders, and ADHD, among others. Some severely neglected children may also show cognitive deficits. Often, the cognitive deficits can be remediated in the right environment, but the emotional deficits can unfortunately have lifelong effects.

Just as behavioral economics is a hybrid discipline of cognitive psychology and economics, neuroeconomics is a hybrid discipline of neuropsychology and economics. They use neural data to see how the brain makes decisions. There are plenty of monkey experiments with actual measurement of neural activity (they literally drill holes in the monkeys' skulls) and have them perform tasks, lots of fMRI experiments, things done with lesion patients and my personal favorite, the trans-cranial magnetic pulse which literally TURNS OFF some parts of the brain. newlinechar  newlinechar It is a very young discipline and, obviously, some of the findings need to be taken with caution (especially given the state of fMRI research) but it's opening lots of interesting doors. My favorite experiment was done by Colin Camerer at Caltech, they had people play the ultimatum game while in fMRI machines. newlinechar  newlinechar For those not familiar, the ultimatum game works like this: there are two players, a proposer and a responder. The proposer is allocated some amount of money, say $10. He then gets to choose an amount of the $10 to offer to the responder. The responder gets to accept or reject. If he accepts, both walk away with their respective amounts. However, if the responder rejects, both walk away with nothing. Conventional 'rational' theory predicts that the proposer should offer as little as possible and the responder should take it (since $1 is better than $0). Obviously, this doesn't happen and offers that are 'insultingly low' are generally rejected (this game has been done all over the world, there are interesting cross cultural differences which I can talk about if anyone's interested). newlinechar  newlinechar When Camerer did this experiment with the fMRI he had responders lie in a scanner and get offers from what they knew were computers and from other people. However, the people were secretly experimental confidants and some purposely made low offers to test the responders' reactions. The fMRI observed activation in regions of the brain whose activation has in other research been correlated with an affective feeling of 'disgust'  (such as when pictures of feces or maggots were shown to subjects) when low offers were known to be made by human subjects (but not when it was known that computers were making them)... it's an interesting finding that goes well along with the role of emotions as important components of decision making that some ev. psych theories push. newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest place for neuroeconomics right now is Caltech, followed by the Baylor College of Medicine and followed by NYU. There's a big debate internal to the economics community about whether we need neural data or whether just decision data is enough, which is an interesting topic in itself.

I tend to think of EMDR the same way that I think of most therapy - it's a way to try to get people to do some form of exposure and response prevention.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Let me explain. I think a lot of human suffering comes from trying to avoid negative thoughts and emotions. By the way, this is an idea most clearly expressed in [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy](http://www.contextualpsychology.org/).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I think most therapy is trying, in one way or another, to get people to have a different relationship with their thoughts and feelings. By different relationship, I mean: somehow feel more willing to have those emotions and not try to suppress, or deaden, or run away from, those feelings and thoughts.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The classic way to do this is [exposure and response prevention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_and_response_prevention) - you *expose* the person to what they are avoiding (e.g., needles; reminders of specific traumatic events), and *prevent* them from doing what they would normally do (e.g., run screaming from the room; self-medicate with meth).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In EMDR, the psychologist has the person expose themselves to normally-avoided things - thoughts, emotions, cues that remind them of the trauma, etc - while following their finger with their eyes. As far as we can tell, the active ingredient in the therapy is the expsoure. If the eye movements do anything, we don't know what it is.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But, hey, if the eye movements make it easier to develop that different relationship with whatever it is you're avoiding, then I say go for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Such statements as Aerik's ever suffer from brevity, of course. Complex ideas are rarely distilled faithfully into bumper stickers. However I'd say, nevertheless, you misread Aerik. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So when the exact situation is reversed and women aren't allowed to do something men can do, you'd argue that women themselves are enforcing the rule so that other women won't act like the inferior gender, right? newlinechar  newlinechar Women police misogyny out of necessity, just like minorities often internalise racism. The system wouldn't work otherwise. The reasoning is different from group to group however. newlinechar  newlinechar Aerik and others (like myself) who point out that men do have limited freedoms will say, quite truthfully, that such is caused by misogyny perpetuating the idea that to emulate women is to lower one's self; while emulating men is considered desirable, especially in the wake of the 1960s. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's an innocuous example: Open a catalogue for a major department store and look at how women's wear is advertised. 'Menswear inspired pinstripes...' 'Menswear themed shirt with a female-inspired cut!' and so forth. Look at the recent trend towards so called 'boyfriend jackets.' newlinechar  newlinechar Can you imagine a 'girlfriend jacket' being sold to men? Or any menswear advertised with 'Feminine touches enhance the design of this season's hot new blazer'? Absolutely not. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In fact, it is a societal construct that hurts BOTH genders. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure who said otherwise here. newlinechar  newlinechar All that is being shown is the simple and fundamental truth: these social constrictions have an *origin.* You seem to be saying that it simply springs fully formed from a vacuum. It doesn't. The idea that women ought to be treated differently has a blowback effect that stabs at men's freedoms and liberties as well. I do not say blowback to *minimise* or marginalise, merely to assert the social location of that set of phenomena relative to its point of origin. newlinechar  newlinechar Women and men enforce each other's oppression but the starting point of the particular set of phenomenon that men have to deal with is the societal idea that masculinity is superior to femininity. newlinechar  newlinechar Note that I said masculinity and not 'men.' It's a complicated set of ideas, for certain and deserves better treatment than a single Reddit post. In the past it was asserted that men were better than women and that's that. These days it's a little more fluid. Women can be men's equals, but only if they take on masculine traits. Femininity equals girlishness equals childishness. To wear pants is to elevate yourself, to wear a skirt is to denigrate yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd highly recommend Julia Serano's magnum opus *Whipping Girl* which brings this phenomenon to light vis a vis the discrete experiences of transsexual women. It's very enlightening. newlinechar  newlinechar In sum, I can't speak for Aerik but I doubt she was asserting that the male populace is monolithic. I certainly don't. But macho masculinity is a knock off effect of patriarchal Christendom (you see something similar in the Islamic world) and its policing is an outgrowth of the repression of women. To be feminine is to be like women, which is bad. newlinechar  newlinechar To return to your opening sentence: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So when the exact situation is reversed and women aren't allowed to do something men can do, you'd argue that women themselves are enforcing the rule so that other women won't act like the inferior gender, right? newlinechar  newlinechar Women will not (save for a few radicals who are the product of much, much more recent political forces) see men as the 'inferior gender.' They will see women as having a certain place that shouldn't be breached.

&gt; How can animals live on this planet for billions of years and yet they don't have taxes or pay for food? newlinechar  newlinechar Not that I like taxes, but wild animals also can kill each other with impunity, which means if you are a wild animal, you have little protection against getting killed.  And they don't pay for food, but they also easily can find themselves in a situation where they might starve to death.  They don't pay for health care, but that's because they don't have it, and a broken leg can easily be a life-ending event if you live in the wild. newlinechar  newlinechar My point is that taxes and money can be used for evil, but by and large, it's a net benefit to live in a civilized society where the social safety net will take care of you.

It's also worth noting that France is not even a 1/3 the size (by population) of the United States.  Factor in a lack of a long history, and waves upon waves of immigrants over the last 350 years, all with their own cultural mores and values, and it's amazing we ever agree on anything at all.

I belive most psychologists now think that dreaming is the brain's way of consolidating memories during sleep.

I could see how it might look like that but not everything is black and white in this area.  I think the main reason you might think i am trying to justify my actions is because of me bringing up a personal example that i am not quite fully recovered from.  I assure you our dog did was not suffering so much that she shouldve been put down.  She wasn's super healthy the last couple months of her life but her condition did not truly degrade to a point where we knew she couldn't recover until the last couple days and since she died of renal failure she did not experience a lot of pain before she passed and any vet/doc will confirm that.

You draw attention to a few of the flaws in your post preemptively, essentially lampshading them.  Your awareness of them doesn't erase them, however.   newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, you admit you can't speak for Aerik, but your viewpoint is far more reasonable (and somewhat closer to my own) than Aerik's ever will be.  You claim I misread him, but you haven't seen how reactionary, how reductionist he can actually be.  It's unreasonable for you to project your own, more eloquent viewpoint on his 'bumper sticker' and portray me as opposing it. newlinechar  newlinechar You also bring up the brevity of Aerik's post, and use it to defend him.  You use the relative brevity of your own post to defend yourself, as well, noting that the issues are too complex for you to address fully.  Your post dwarfs mine, but you refuse to give mine the benefit of the doubt in any instance.   newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially, you outright asked me for a consideration that you don't give in return.  Don't you see how inconsistent it is for you to assume I think societal constructs spring magically out of thin air, simply because I reference them without taking the time to share my theory on their extremely complex interconnected causes? newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, you quote my opening sentence without noting the context.  The entire opening sentence is an *example* of a fallacious argument, and the supposed weakness you find in it is actually part of my point.  For someone who scried the guts of Aerik's post for meaning that I've reason to believe doesn't exist, you seem relatively oblivious to the overt meaning of my post. newlinechar  newlinechar For all that, you've definitely added the most actual substance to this thread, and deserve an upvote for it.
Does anyone care to answer, or just mod me down?  I was being serious.  Isn't it illegal to detain someone and deny them a phone call? newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I don't understand why I was being modded down to begin with.
I don't think the issue here is the karma itself.  The issue is the marginalization of a users contributions to the site.  This is a community run website, and this is a behavior that attacks that basic functionality.  newlinechar  newlinechar Reddit hasn't been broken all along, and it's not broken now.  When you're on the internet, you're going to have trolls.  That's just the unfortunate reality.    Is banning them going to change anything?  Unlikely.  newlinechar  newlinechar What makes banning them so much worse than their own behavior?  These are not people who are contributing to the community.  Not to mention, banning simply removes the username; they'll be back a few moments later with a new one.  So why are we worried about such unimportant things? newlinechar  newlinechar If all the information was available, we could treat people who spam downvotes just like any other spammer.  That's my only point.

I can agree with the term 'nearly'.  A huge majority of it was purely for alcohol and drugs that I saw.  It was to the point where me and my girl could walk down the street downtown and practically have a line form in front of us so people could trade their panhandling money for dope.  We would have everything from half grams to 5 dollar bags made up for just this reason. newlinechar  newlinechar Havent heard of anyone starving to death, but there was a well known older guy who died of exposure because he didnt make it to the shelter on time so they didnt let him in.  He was off his meds, and was kind of out of it upstairs as a result --so he just went up into the woods to sleep and never woke up.  This outraged the homeless community pretty good.

Yes, but you'll note that all of these 'conspiracies' of which you speak are actually known events. None of them was really secret for very long. People might not *care* much, but they're all well known. newlinechar  newlinechar That's because it's basically impossible to keep a conspiracy with any significant number of people involved secret for very long, especially when it involves murdering lots of people. 
Not trying to be condescending here, but how did you graduate with a CS degree without taking statistics? Did you also skip differential equations and multivariable calculus? newlinechar  newlinechar I'll note that I currently work for a hedge fund doing machine learning research and development. I graduated with an MS in CS (focused mostly on software engineering) and had more or less forgotten most of my statistics background. Fortunately, I knew my boss personally and he is a very patient guy who doesn't mind teaching. I started working, I've refreshed my mind of all the above mentioned subject matter and the concepts stick better now that I use them frequently. newlinechar  newlinechar I would say your task determines how much knowledge you need. If you just have a variation on a textbook problem, like getting a neural network to drive a car for example, then you can probably just mimic how other people did things and muddle through. If you want to apply algorithms to solve very challenging and/or novel problems, you need a more in-depth understanding of how these things work; that means you need some basic statistics knowledge and a decent amount of personal time investment. If your goal is to push the boundaries of general ML research and create your own novel algorithms that are better than the state of the art, you'll need to know a lot of statistics and math.
&gt;I'd think there's also a strong argument that simply using a header would constitute fair use, similarly to how referencing chapter and article titles in a bibliography is fair use. newlinechar  newlinechar [Here's Linus writing on that very topic](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/475654/focus=476049). :-)

Perhaps this problem would be solved if we could introduce and encourage people to use streetcars? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar These cars could move suburbanites to larger transportation networks such as train stations that would transfer them to city areas for work. During evening and working hours they could drive people to commercial areas for shopping and entertainment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If we removed zoning laws, ideally many businesses we require would be able to be just a bike's ride away from home. People could bike daily to grocery stores to purchase only the ingredients they need to make dinner for that day. In that manner we could improve health and wean our dependence on oil. But that assumes a lot of things. For example, that Americans had the dietary habits of Europeans, and that businesses would not be obnoxiously loud or bright during night hours.

My freshmen year in college a met a pretty cute blonde chick who lived 2 floors below me (in a big freshmen dorm) and was trying to hook up with her.  Things were going well, and I was anticipating getting my dick wet, but this brunette chick who was hanging out with us kept hitting on me hardcore.  She wasn't bad looking, but definitely not as hot as the one I was trying to hook up with.  The only problem was since this girl kept flirting with me (while I was kind of trying to ignore her) the hot chick started backing off.  It turns out it was her sister who was visiting from high school (and she was 17...oops).  So the hot sister, seeing her little not as pretty sister wanted me, basically stop flirting with me.  By then I was pretty drunk and kind of pissed, and I decided that I'm getting my dick wet one way or the other.  So I let the sister blow me (she was really good, incidentally, and swallowed) and I bounced. newlinechar  newlinechar I still see the hot sister around school sometimes, and one time we started flirting again, but she said 'I like you, but if you think you're getting with both of the (her last name) sisters, don't get your hopes up.'  So that was that. newlinechar  newlinechar But anyway, I have an awesome gf now, so I'm happy :)

Extrapolating a numeric sequence is actually pretty simple. It tries an arithmetic sequence first - if that fails, it tries geometric, and then parabolic. newlinechar  newlinechar So first it tries assuming that 2nd-1st will be the same as 3rd-2nd, and so on. If that matches the examples, each term will be 1st + (2nd-1st)*n. newlinechar  newlinechar Otherwise, it assumes that 2nd/1st will be the same as 3rd/2nd, and so on. So if that matches the examples, each term will be 1st * (2nd/1st)^n. newlinechar  newlinechar Otherwise, if there are at least 4 examples, it checks whether 4th = 3rd + (3rd-2nd) + ((3rd-2nd)-(2nd-1st)). Er..., well, something like that, IIRC.

Plato is wonderful stull, and extremely readable, but the later stuff, and especially The Republic, go down some very weird thought paths and seem to espouse something completely different from the 'earlier' dialogs.  The apology is my favorite, though it isn't really 'philosophy'. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd recommend Dennet - like *Darwin's Dangerous Idea*, or *Consciousness Explained*.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'd recommend William James - like Will to Believe.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think Kierkegaard is fantastic, and highly literary, though it's really a crapshoot if you'll find it to your liking.  It's pretty eccentric. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; I'll bet that 700 billion dollars would figure out a way. newlinechar  newlinechar I just had a thought. Today's story about [California building a space-based solar power plant](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/akbfx/solar_plant_in_space_gets_goahead_california/) to beam power to Earth via radio-waves could be combined with receivers on the roofs of electric vehicles to enable cars that never need to stop for a recharge and with no need to build a nationwide network of charging stations. That would go a long way towards eliminating oil dependence. newlinechar 
I agree with most of your post, but you might want to visit other parts of the world. I was impressed with New Zealand and Australia. They have a lot of what makes the U.S. great while avoiding our disastrous mistakes. newlinechar  newlinechar Australia has no national debt &amp; minimal personal debt. They have a knowledgeable electorate that *votes*. Military is a small part of their national budget. They prevent corporations from getting big enough to influence government. newlinechar  newlinechar I won't bore you with the all rest; visit 'em &amp; see. I haven't traveled enough to say they're the best country, but they are better than us.

&gt;It's unreasonable for you to project your own, more eloquent viewpoint on his 'bumper sticker' and portray me as opposing it. newlinechar  newlinechar Fair enough! newlinechar  newlinechar Out of all the people I've spoken to on Reddit I've rarely encountered such a thoughtful deconstruction of my words and I thank you. newlinechar  newlinechar For what it's worth, my bad.

I'm a college student who spends fifteen bucks a week on food.  I have a computer because it's necessary.  80% of my money goes to rent for my studio apartment (all utilities included, thankfully, and even then, it's nearly the cheapest place in the city) and my phone bill.  I get internet from the bar across the street.  I couldn't afford the insurance for a car, let alone an actual car.  A tv is not a necessary expense, so I don't own one, and I also couldn't afford the cable/satellite to justify owning one anyway.

You've given me some interesting things to consider.   newlinechar For now, I'll just give you a first take. Thanks for chiming in. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't trying to set up a straw man. This is really a rather complex issue. I was making an off-the-cuff rhetorical analysis of labeling all supernatural thoughts and belief systems as 'irrational'. I wasn't trying to suggest that there is a conscious attempt to dehumanize these individuals (hence, my use of 'crypto'). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In one's mind such a person would already be *inhuman*... newlinechar  newlinechar Dehumanizing someone (or a people group) is a matter of degree. A human being is a rather complex phenomenon. Whatever it is to be human, we can agree that it is a least a collection of a number of qualities (however anyone wants to define them). Attacking a specific aspect, such as rational decision-making, shouldn't (I hope) lead one to move an individual from the 'human' column to the 'inhuman' column. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Using rationality to solve problems in the world by definition requires the use of the empirical variables, or else it is purely an abstract process. newlinechar  newlinechar So, does math always refer to empirical variables when it is useful? (I'm not a mathematician)

It's called having a [word-finding difficulty](http://www.wordfinding.com/definition&amp;characteristics.html), sometimes also known as the ['tip of the tongue' phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue), or in French, presque vu (almost seen).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It happens to everyone at least some of the time, but some people experience it more frequently than others. It seems to be especially common in individuals with reading difficulties or attention/information processing problems.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are a couple of theories about why it happens. The one that makes the most sense to me is that sometimes you can pull the semantic representation (meaning) of the word from your memory, but for some reason can't pull up the phonemic representation (sound) of the word. This may be because you have lots of different neural connections to the meaning of the word - e.g., other words that have similar meanings, times when you've heard the word, a visualization of what the word means, etc - so that gives you lots of possible 'cues' to facilitate your memory of the meaning. However, you only have one connection to the phonemic meaning of the word - how it sounds - and so if you can't remember that, it's just really hard to pull up the word.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Word finding strategies include relaxing (often that works, if you give it enough time), and trying to help yourself recall the phonemic representation through various strategies. The most commonly-used strategy is to mentally go through the alphabet and see if any of the letters jog your memory as the first letter of the word. You can also try singing or saying the sentence that you are trying to remember the word for aloud in a silly voice, to see if changing up the modality helps your recall.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. Thanks for the New Year's wishes - back at ya. Is Australia awesome? It seems awesome.

I definitely agree that the Ripley as a mom subplot really *really* should have made the final cut (as should the sentry guns), though in retrospect I'm glad they cut the scene with the colonists and Newt's family (it's fun to watch after being familiar with the movie, but I think it's much more ominous as a viewer to not see LV-426 until Ripley and the marines do).  That said, the documentary done for *Aliens* is really incredible.  It's incredibly thorough and really makes you appreciate all the work that went into the movie, even just the theatrical cut  :)

The reason such 'appeals to nature' are typically fallacious is that people use 'it's natural' to mean 'there is an evolutionary trend to suggest that what I said previously is true' when no such trend or evolution exists. If they were to spell out exactly what they mean, they would immediately notice that their reasoning is flawed. For example, there is no evolutionary history or biological evidence to suggest that cocaine is 'good' or that natural plants can't harm you, but suddenly when you say 'natural' it seems as though you don't need any actual evidence anymore. I blame this on religion: people assume that a higher power created everything; therefore, everything created by this higher power is good. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I am saying that a trend toward morality being the default actions and immorality being those actions selected against evolutionarily exists, which it does. There is no fallacy in my argument.

A theory that has been around for years is straightforward:  that what we think of as intelligence, or more, a specialized subset of intelligence that lends itself to the use of abstracts in thought, is a recessive mutation.  More so, that intellectualism and autism are two types of the same thing. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a more recent process for divining this that is intriguing in its own right.  It is the idea that a normal person is able to have a deeply focused, or deeply unfocused, state of mind.  In the former state, one would seem to be intellectual, because you could focus on a problem for a long time to solve it without distraction.  In an unfocused state of mind, a person could be very artistic, and draw great inspiration out of their nebulous subconscious, again without distraction. newlinechar  newlinechar However, in mankind's ancient past, we figured out that neither state of mind, either focused or unfocused, is conducive to survival.  So as a species we developed the technique of talking to ourselves, that makes our attention vacillate between the two states.  A protective mechanism which we still use today, and unconsciously teach to our children, even though we are seldom in a survival situation. newlinechar  newlinechar But people who are unable to properly talk to themselves might get stuck in either a focused state, like someone with Asperger's Syndrome; or an unfocused state, like Autism.

The key is empathy, and that is in short supply in the United States these days.  We have to care about the other; the other person, the other culture or race, the other species, the other environments we don't live in.  Our capacity for empathy is what makes humanity so different from the majority of the animal kingdom.  It can unite us in social structures of mutual compassion.  This is easy to see at the local level, in tribes, churches, and in our communities.  We have to expand our application of empathy to the entire planet.  Its the only way we will be compelled to take responsibility for what is done to the other, and in doing so take responsibility for our collective selves. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We are at a crossroads in human development.  I only see two basic structures that could unite the world in a long lasting civilization.  Either we take responsibility for ourselves by caring for the other, or a tyrannical hierarchy of control will take that responsibility by preventing us from hurting the other.  Short of either one, our current form of civilization will expire once the resources become too scarce for our infinite growth.
Yes, that was a clever rephrasing of what I said and quite accurate. I don't care if people feel monogamy is necessary, I'm not trying to push my perspective on anyone.

If you were watched by a police officer at your job after 'expressing a political view', then you probably said something a bit more outrageous than you're letting on.

Um... in terms of design? You think about ways to express whatever algorithms you want to express, then try to design a notation that expresses them without being too verbose, yet not too unreadably terse, and doesn't have too many surprising behaviours that catch people out. newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of implementation? You write a program that can take some text, parse it into a parse tree (usually), and then either execute that parse tree directly (the lazy man's way), or else compile it into some efficient lower-level language like assembly, or java bytecode. Needless to say, I'm doing the former.

I don't have a problem. I have hurt feelings, speaking on behalf of MANY girls, when I learned my boyfriend jerked off to other girls (porn and IRL). I don't think about other guys. To rephrase my argument in light of all the comments, I'm arguing that monogamy is obsolete because women who believe in monogamy also believe they are the only one's. If I'm not the only one, why am I dedicating myself to one man for my life when he enjoys many imagined women sexually through the 'relationship'. Why should women be bound to one man, when men aren't bound to one women? It's like women are getting the short end of the stick. Guys use porn, women use romantic novels? No way. I think maybe guys use porn and women are allowed to be free and let go when they are no longer desired wholly by a man. I only think of my man and to know that it's not mutual breaks my heart. But I'm trying to rationalize and understand, with reddits help, how this is normal but introducing the counter argument. 
I'll grant you all points. I admit, partially because it's completely irrelevant whether or not you're right about those points. But they're still granted nonetheless.

If you do, read it. newlinechar  newlinechar But don't start vandalizing stuff that might be enjoyed by others just because you have a problem with it. newlinechar

That's largely because the word and identity 'liberal' has been demonized in the United States: you can see that in your own post, liberals prefer to identify themselves as 'progressives' while conservatives have a baseline respect from everybody. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What you will find in the associated polling is that many of these so-called 'conservatives' have 'liberal' views on things: [only 18% of U.S. adults want abortion to be illegal](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1576/Abortion.aspx). Yet 45% identify as 'pro-life'. It's about slogans and identities, not fundamentally different values.
Have you read the Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell? In it Gladwell provides a study known as the Colorado Adoption Project, where they compared 245 pregnant woman who were going to put up their kids for adoption with 245 parents with their biological children. As expected, in the end, they found that children brought up by their biological mother were fairly similar to their parents, however for the adopted kids, their scores were nothing like their adoptive parents. The adopted kids were 'no more similar in their personality or intellectual skills to the people who raised them, fed them, clothed them, read to them, taught them, and loved them for sixteen years than they are to any two adults taken at random off the street.'  newlinechar  newlinechar And basically what Gladwell came to conclude is that children become who they are through their peer group, and not through straight parenting.

If we don't confront china about their policies, we can continue to lead them down a road that allows them to assume that their growth is eternal, just like we did to japan.  When we decide to create economic problems in china, we can.  When we do that, revolution will occur at our whim. When revolution occurs, we will be ready to take advantage of it more than we already have taken advantage of their population.  They will then, fall into line with globalization and let go of their delusions of sovereignty.  The jew (Krugman) only pretends that he doesn't know what we're doing.  You'll see.

This categorization is controversial however, as historians differ as to whether the famine was a deliberate part of the campaign of repression against kulaks and others, or simply an unintended consequence of the struggle over forced collectivization.

Took a lot of pain to gain this 'wisdom'! But in the end no-one is responsible for anyone else's happiness - it is silly to imagine that someone will 'make' you happy. My wife and I had a phrase 'I deal with my shit, you deal with your shit and then there will be no shit in the middle' I think it worked and there seems to be no stress whatsoever in being together. The thing is men and women have been conditioned into role or game playing in order to hook up. What people don't understand is that the games are simply a mating ritual to reinforce initial attraction only. Once you have a 'relationship' the games are meant to stop.

No it's not terminal. The issue is that she has arthritis throughout her body. Unfortunately it appears to bug her the most on the pad of her foot and as such she's licked it for the past year to help 'scratch' the itch. As you know cat's tongues are like sandpaper, so she's essentially killed the tissue on her pad by licking it so much and has made a bloody mess of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar As of a couple months ago I noticed she started to get a bit more agitated with it as she would actually gnaw at it trying to relieve the 'itch' from the arthritis. When I looked closer it almost looked like she had punctured through to the bone. We had the vet take a look at it, but all he could do was give her some steroids to help with the itching but of course this is something he had to inject and it would only last a few days. So for months on end I would sterilize the wound, apply polysporin and wrap in gauze. After I wrapped it up, I even had to use hockey tape and tape it tightly to her foot otherwise she would tear off the bandage. I went about for a month or so changing the bandage every night, but at her age she doesn't appear to heal fast, if heal at all, so there was really no change. At this point we had the vet stitch it close, and since then she's been living with a cone on her head and limping around. I think she's doing better then she was months ago as it's obviously not bugging her as much, but she still try's to get at it which is why the cone is still on her head. newlinechar  newlinechar We all know she's nearing the end, and it will be the worst day of my life when we finally decide to put her down.

I found this out the hard way when I was running out of disk space and wanted to install a new Steam game on a different drive than Steam - not an option, had to reinstall Steam and all associated games on the new drive (in hindsight, I probably could have moved it somehow with the backup feature, but regardless, Steam and it's games are inseparable). newlinechar  newlinechar The DRM would still be there I think, just as it is with a boxed game, and since Steam installs in the most insane way ever (browse your Steam directory, you won't find a folder in there for any of your games, but yet somehow they are in there) it's probably pretty secure.  Not saying it may not get cracked, but lets face it, boxed games get cracked in days (Modern Warfare 2 took less than 12 hours I hear) so what's the difference really.

I have never studied Rosetta Stone courses, so do not know what they cover. However, I can explain the Czech language a bit. Firstly, there is literary Czech - this is quite a formal version which you would use for writing letters or books or newspapers. Then there is spoken Czech, which is what you would use in polite conversation. Then there is colloquial Czech, which you would use in informal conversations. There is, of course, also 'street slang' which is mostly restricted to kids. newlinechar  newlinechar Then there are also regional differences. The Prague version of Czech does have an accent which some people like and some do not. It sounds a little bit like 'singing' in that some words are held longer than in other areas of the country. newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of what Czech you learn in courses, there are plenty of books and tapes for learning Czech and most cover a mix of the formal literary and spoken variants, and usually have a small section introducing the colloquial.

When they made the predictions 50 years ago, they had no idea what they were getting into.

No one has been working on general AI for decades- the reason we haven't seen progress is because literally no one was trying.  NOW they really are.

due to this event I had to change job sites. A year later, at a gas station I saw a co-worker from the original site and she was compelled to tell me 'what happened.' She said the original complaint person was stealing money and was afraid I would notice, see, or otherwise find out, so this person embellished my everyday political views and supersized them, cooked up a big scary story. The point is the official police dept. was already primed to be the lacky of this sort of drama and the thief-complaintant was smart enough to use this opportunity to eliminate what they thought was a threat (me) to their stealing. The complainant did this action toward me with specific intent to get me removed from the job site, probably intending that I be fired or otherwise disappeared though that did not happen, I was simply transfered to a different site, likely due to the officer observing that I was sensible and moderate. I immediately realized that the officer was checking me out. I probably said as much or alluded to this while doing my work in a consistent and good natured manner. newlinechar I do not believe this situation would have occurred so automatically without the extreme tension in the air from the BushCo regime, that everyone was supposed to be on 'alert' ad infinitum and find a scapegoat. This was also when people were driving around with 'get bin Laden' target stickers on vehicles and the like. In retrospect, I did not express any particularly radical and certainly not any dangerous views. It was just that at the time, no one anywhere dared to say anything about anything and in this regard I may have been conspicuous. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, during the Reagan era, early on I saw that the man was a liar and bullshit artist and I was stunned at his popularity and how so many had their heart warmed up by this complete stranger.

While it sounds crazy, it is an archeological fact. I wonder what aspects of our oldest legends and monuments are attributable to this race? newlinechar  newlinechar It is theorized they had a prefrontal cortex (referred to as the seat of intelligence) that was 53% larger than ours. I really wonder what happened to them. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; ... brain size is about 30 percent larger than our own—that is, a 1,750-cc brain to our average of 1,350 cc. And that leads to an increase in the prefrontal cortex of a staggering 53 percent. If these principled relations among brain parts hold true, then Boskops would have had not only an impressively large brain but an inconceivably large prefrontal cortex. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The prefrontal cortex is closely linked to our highest cognitive functions. It makes sense out of the complex stream of events flowing into the brain; it places mental contents into appropriate sequences and hierarchies; and it plays a critical role in planning our future actions. Put simply, the prefrontal cortex is at the heart of our most flexible and forward-looking thoughts. newlinechar

I had a similar experience. My cousins were kinda rich and got the game, so me and my two other brothers went to their house and it was 7 boys playing this game. It was by far the best game we've ever played and were really into it. I was the youngest and for some reason, really liked bubble man's power, and kept telling everyone to use it at all moments while constantly being told to stfu. Then comes the last Wily boss, and the motherfucker turns into a goddammed alien. I watch as my cousin uses all the weapons, and then I mutter, 'Maybe Bubble man?' 'Are you fucking kidding? The weakest power defeating this alien? No one would ever be that cruel.' Then we won on my advice. For a while, I was the shit.

Dude don't panic.

Logic is flawed and does not equal all situations. What about someone sacrificing themselves to save someone else. Being philosophical is fine, but reality is very different. In the end we all die, it is just how we go out and what the circumstances are that change. A mature man sees the reality of life and can make decisions based on that. An immature man lives only for reasons, living in some respects may be the immature option when confronted with serious choices.
Well, military paratrooping and skydiving are a bit different - the highest jump I made was from 1250 feet, and all of mine were static line jumps (line attaches your parachute to the plane, so as you fall, it opens your chute).  The military does have a free-fall program (HALO), but I never went.  Jumping can be summed up as the pre-jump dog and pony show (that can last sometimes 12 hours - manifesting, equipment checks, waiting around, blah blah blah), a while of being crammed into an airplane in the most uncomfortable position imaginable for the flight, and then the rush of throwing yourself into a (often) pitch black sky at around 800 feet, going ~120 mph, with 40-50 lbs of gear strapped to you and a weapon on your side, praying the Air Force didn't drop you over the trees (again).  Honestly, at least half of my jumps can be characterized as immense elation at the knowledge that soon I will be uncramped, and on the ground, and can finally pee. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Cool stories - I have quite a few stories.

[So #89 Kevin's Quest, part 1](http://www.legorobotcomics.com/?id=89) happened to my buddy in college. The pieces of this story were cobbled together a week later after it happened... newlinechar  newlinechar He did acid (mostly paper) in college and would see how much he could do and not completely lose his mind. One night, at another buddy's apartment, he did just that - *lose his fucking mind*. newlinechar  newlinechar He started by ripping off all his clothes. He'd go back and forth between being calm and laughable, to paranoid and menacing. This went on for hours. Our other buddy (who rented the apartment) called in another buddy of ours whose role for the evening was to be the 'big guy' ... the guy who would straighten out problems for those going on a bad trip. To be the big guy, you had to be a) calm, b) not on acid, and c) big. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'big guy' got there and found my buddy who was tripping ever-so-hard in his own car, completely naked. He couldn't figure out how to drive, but was curiously preoccupied with the steering wheel, alternately playing with it like a 3-year-old who enjoyed it, then wanted to see it ripped off. newlinechar  newlinechar The big guy could not calm my buddy down, and after an hour or two... left. ***The big guy left***, and that only meant that now an otherwise complete lunatic was left to himself and his tripped-out mind. newlinechar  newlinechar The sun was starting to come up, and my buddy made his way out of his car, but apparently couldn't find the apartment of our common friend, as they all looked the same to him. This was college, and people were going to class... and he was apparently harrassing some of them. The last thing he himself remembers is being on the ground in the morning dew, with a cop on his back and paramedics swarming him. He says he remembers severely resisting arrest and screaming his head off. newlinechar  newlinechar When he awoke, he was in a hospital bed with straps- severely confused, and feeling like complete crap. After a while, a nurse walked in...  newlinechar  newlinechar **Buddy**: *What happened?* newlinechar  newlinechar **Nurse**: &lt;with a *screw-you* tone of voice&gt; *Well, here are your parents, why don't you ask them?* newlinechar  newlinechar Needless to say, his parents were completely ballistic about it- their star-never-do-wrong-golden-child had his stomach pumped after being arrested by cops and subdued and knocked out. newlinechar  newlinechar They stopped paying for college, took the car they *just* bought him right back *and sold it*, and barely spoke to him for a few years (*and they were really close*). newlinechar  newlinechar He was a crazy guy.

Nah, you missed the point. I'm not agreeing with the topic, I'm just pointing out a problem in the logic.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with a large 'Green' or 'Eco' movement of people limiting child bearing is this. IF/WHEN we return to a more community/self sufficient home only two children and two parents will be working constantly to produce the food for themselves. If we are apart of a community, that makes it easier, and allows people to specialize. newlinechar  newlinechar The whole reason we had large families to begin with was so that we had assistance in getting food.  newlinechar  newlinechar Population control is very important, but I think we all have a pretty slanted view on it. In the end, the population will readjust naturally. Not because we all decide to limit our child output, but because the world will shake it's back, and kill the majority of us so we can begin respawning again. newlinechar  newlinechar If that *DOESN'T* happen, we will be forced to remedy the situation ourselves the same way England did, send it to a different locale. Colonizing space. newlinechar  newlinechar The society we're in doesn't change on the majority unless it is forced to, and we are not at that juncture yet.

I'm usually not this direct on my own blog, partly because I really wish I knew far more about math and science.

(1) A young person can study whatever he wants to study and make a good life for himself. This is the single most important feature here. Sooner or later politicians will spoil this I am afraid but hold on to it and the society will have hopeful, cheerful and positive youngsters. newlinechar  newlinechar (2) I find America to be very open to new people, new food, new clothes....whatever. It is very amazing and nice. I did not even know so many different kinds of foods existed in this world until I came here. Maybe it is because people here can afford various things. Whatever the reasons maybe, the adventurous nature is very commendable. newlinechar  newlinechar (3) I feel like politicians pay a heavy price for their transgressions. I have seen evidence for it. In India there are confirmed thugs in power. Murderers, thieves, and scoundrels seem to be unable to get political power here after their action are known. That is a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar (4) There is a general politeness. I haven't seen anyone ill-treat me for being brown. newlinechar  newlinechar (5) I think the country is business friendly and that is good. In India, by the time you start a business, you have already bribed a dozen people....and then every dealing with the government is a nightmare. Things are getting better....but here things are much more streamlined. newlinechar  newlinechar (6) There is heated debate about a lot of things here. It is a good thing. It is ok to call a politician a donkey or a monkey and all is cool. If you do that in India, you'll be in some kind of trouble for sure. Being able to keep politicians on a leash (to the extent possible) is a good thing and I see that here. newlinechar  newlinechar more in the AMA as the question come up...

Totally agreed, the core gameplay feels really sloppy.  Beyond the engine's problems, I don't like the combat design either.  What stands in my memory most is the very first fight.  After 9 minutes of intro, you start off with a terribly awkward _melee fight_.  It's even more awkward than Prey's starting wrench duel, and you're almost certain to get hit.  I don't know if its because the enemy's attack animation isn't clear, or if it's just too hard to tell what the range is on their wrench, or, well, it's definitely too hard to tell the range on your own wrench... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 5 minutes later you are introduced to the actual gameplay: stun, then attack.  The game's combat makes more sense here than the rest of the game, but this introduces another of the game's core problems:  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Overly complicated controls.  Christ, this is an FPS but I need to fiddle around mid-combat with plasmid switching, weapon switching, ammo switching, refilling eve, using medkits, looting, ducking, running, using the correct mouse button, it doesn't work at all.  The only way to keep the game simple is to just pick one plasmid and one weapon and stick with them as much as possible.  Then when the weapon runs out of ammo, run and hide while you try to remember what button opens the ammo selection screen. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The plot is exciting at first, but they repeat the same ideas over and over.  Each sound recording you pick up is tedious reinforcement of a simple point about Rapture you understood the last 5 times they told you.  Oh, splicing really screws people up huh?  Seems like Rapture didn't turn out so well, huh?  The plot itself, beyond the environment and morality stuff, isn't very interesting either, and mostly serves to keep the player moving throughout the city.  Also, the game's themes aren't very deep, but its nice that they're there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The game's best ideas are the enviornment and upgrade-system stuff, but the latter wasn't implemented very well, isn't balanced, and isn't well-suited to the FPS genre.
My favorite Onion article of all time. Hands down.
A few thoughts about this post: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Go back to school. The degree from a non-regionally accredited school will hurt you in the long run. I'm really, really, really, really sorry that you ended up there, and wish there was something that could be said to be more encouraging than this - but you have plenty of life yet to live. Don't let that degree hold you back. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. If you are a fundamentalist, understand that all that will ever have to happen for your life to be royally schrewed up is a single power-hungry pastor who feels threatend by your success. 'I just don't think this is the person God has for us' and you are on the street. Just like that. There are no safeguards, there are no replays, there is no justice in this world.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Start attending the sort of church in which you wish to work. If there's not one nearby, move. You can get a retailish job anywhere. newlinechar  newlinechar 4. Volunteer in that church's youth &amp; children ministry. No one wants to work with middle school students, so you can start there. newlinechar  newlinechar 5. Develop the senior pastor as a cheif mentor, and the youth pastor as another sort of mentor. newlinechar  newlinechar 6. Keep working on that degree from an accredited school. Once you've gotten that degree, go to seminary and get a MA in religious studies. You can get a MA at around 32-36 credit hours, as opposed to the 90 hour masters of divinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar 7. When things are ready, you'll get a job in a church similar to the one you're attending, probably as a youth pastor. This is key. Big churches hire ppl from other big churches. Rarely do ppl make huge jumps upward in church hiring. Better to volunteer at a big church and move frmo there than try to move up from a small church. newlinechar  newlinechar 8. Keep growing in faith and knowledge and love. Love most of all. 
Upvoted for calling bullshit on the 'natural state.' newlinechar  newlinechar That phrases just pisses me off. The distinction between 'natural' and 'unnatural' is completely arbitrary. Termites build mounds; that's natural. Humans build sky scrappers; that's not. Come again? newlinechar  newlinechar Humans are animals. What we do is, by definition, natural. You _cannot_ keep an environment in a 'natural' state by artificially maintaining it against outside forces, human or otherwise. It ends up being just as unnatural as a zoo, only on a larger scale. newlinechar  newlinechar No, if you think that human activity is unnatural, than environs maintained by humans in a 'natural' state is also unnatural.  newlinechar

There seems to be two types of gamers now:  Competitive Gamers and Escape Gamers. newlinechar  newlinechar The competitive gamers play Online FPSs, RTSs, or Action/competitive RPGs, etc.  This includes games like MW, Halo, L4D, TF2, DotA, Starcraft, or even Diablo II PvP.  We thrive on strategy, skill, experience, and dominating our competition by being better.  Video games are like a sport to us. newlinechar  newlinechar The escapist gamers play games to escape.  They play games with deep worlds and stories and are looking for a fun evening in an interesting environment.  They play games like RPGs, Deus Ex, Assassin's Creed, Dragon Age,  and BioShock. newlinechar  newlinechar The escapists constantly bitch about how they bought MW2 but the single player was shit and how they wasted $60 (Seriously, who buys a competitive online FPS and complains about the story mode?).  The competitive gamers bitch about how BioShock has a poor cover system, weak weapons, and doesn't reward traditional shooting skills.  This is why I can almost never agree with Yahtzee's reviews of games.  He's simply playing games for a different reason than I am.  I watch videos of people playing to find new strategies, I read wikis about the games, and I find number charts and do calculations in games to optimize my play; not to escape into an interactive story where my enemy and I take turns hitting each other.

Approximately 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease develop some symptoms of schizophrenia either on account of upregulation of D2-like dopamine receptors precipitated by the death of the dopamine-producing neurons that constitute the substantia nigra, which loss characterizes the disease or rather *is* the gross pathophysiology of the disease; on account of the dopaminergic medication they take to compensate for the dearth of D2-family dopamine receptor agonism which causes their symptoms; or, most probably, both. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the most frequent symptoms of dopaminergic-therapy-induced psychosis is paranoia and another, less prominent but strongly related symptom, magical thinking.  It seems to me that - and this is merely conjecture - sufferers of Parkinson's disease ought to be more suspicious of scammers and, thus, on average less likely than the average person to become ensnared.   Curious. newlinechar  newlinechar Although, as you mention, dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and other regions within the limbic system correlates positively with expectation of reward, so that may offset the paranoia? newlinechar  newlinechar Can you provide a citation for that claim?

Really? I loved the conclusion of the Dark Tower series. I thought it was perfect.  newlinechar  newlinechar (spoilers)  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar While I was disappointed with some of the offhand ways people die in the last book or two, I think the end of Roland's quest was spot on. Very Buddhist in that his quest repeats over and over. Though he begins his quest for the final time with his horn, implying that maybe this time will be different. Maybe because of some choices he made, this time will be the last. Also, in the end of the poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came' (which the series was inspired by), Childe Roland reaches the dark tower, blows his horn, and his quest is over. Maybe when Roland reaches the tower for the last time, with his horn, his quest will finally end (reach nirvana). newlinechar  newlinechar (/spoilers) newlinechar  newlinechar Brilliant IMO.

Personally, I'd expect it to do exactly what it does.  newlinechar  newlinechar The way I'd look at it is that you start with an array [10,1,2,3,4], go 'Hang on, there's a range in there - I'll replace it', and end up with [10,1..4].

&gt;That's poverty. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's perspective.  Perhaps one day society will consider the act of cooking one's own food characteristic of poverty.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In China, popular thought is that vegetarianism is a sign of poverty. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Certainly, street vendors here are not engaging in a losing proposition, especially since their relatively well-groomed appearance (for the most part) and clothing indicates that they are probably supporting themselves.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's my thought that independent vendors offering pricing based on the result of bargaining and haggling is a much more efficient resource allocation process than fixed pricing.  Those with inelastic demand for a relatively commoditized product, likely the wealthier consumers willing to pay for convenience, will pay higher prices than the poor, moving closer to a system of [perfect price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination).  A vendor who is able to maximize producer surplus may then pass the extra profits along to the (poorer) consumer who will take the extra effort to bargain for a lower price.  The wealthy consumer will effectively subsidize the poorer consumer (and the vendor), and more products will be sold, allowing the manufacturer to capture the benefits of economies of scale. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Alas, the concept of bargaining is all but dead in America. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How many meals can the restaurant workers afford by a day's work? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is something for which it is very hard to find statistics.  The previously mentioned website does not apparently provide statistics on the cost of basic essentials; probably because economists adhere to the concept of purchasing power parity which dictates that prices should be the same everywhere for similar goods.

 Okay forewarning: I am drunk, and I almost have my associates in psychology. Also my abnormal psych teacher pushed his theory down our throats. So, if you strongly disbelieve, or have information against this PLEASE share it with me. I am also presenting myself with a disadvantage because I am quite drunk, and I know my information in the field is limited. newlinechar  newlinechar Sydney Walker disapproves modern day 'psychology' for two main reasons. 1) Most people are misdiagnosed stating most abnormal psychological behavior is because of biological reasons. 2) Modern day psychology is in 'bizarro land'[read: bizarro = comic book term for disfunctional],because some of diagnosis were created in questionable terms such as: homosexuality(used to be in DSM,but not now),good house wife syndrome(the book says this abnormal behavior was decided upon a few 'powerful' men on a boat trip after they were drinking.(It is now not as well) newlinechar  newlinechar Okay, so the book is divided into chapters by case studies. He states how this patient was titled schizophrenic(insert random diagnosis) by most therapists before they came to him as a last resort. The medium is how he tries to figure out the biological symptoms. It ends with how he came to a biological conclusion. The schizophrenic behavior was caused by Syphilis(insert biological cure, instead of psychological medicine). He cures the Syphilis with anti-biotics and the schizophrenic behavior is gone. newlinechar  newlinechar In conclusion:  The author believes psychology needs more of a 'unf' than just 'thought-theory.' to grow into the 'everyone curable with the right medicine' field it has transformed into. newlinechar  newlinechar I am really drunk so if a sentence or paragraph doesn't make sense please reply and I will try my best tomorrow to explain myself better.

BangWanger has the right of it here, and I say this as someone who spent a lot of time arguing the point when 1999 became 2000.  The simple truth is that a decade or millennium is a number of years, and can be chosen to start arbitrarily at any year.  The fact that most of the western world uses a calendar whose first millennium and decade 'started' in a year ending in 1 doesn't make the last ten years any less of a decade. newlinechar  newlinechar Feel free arguing with the idiots who claim that the years 2000 up to and including 2010 are a decade though. ;)

I've heard these claims about SecuROM before, but I've still never seen any evidence of it being installed as a ring 0 program, opening ports, or specifically sending information back to 'home'.

Many American public transit systems blow dead goats for nickles because there's a stigma attached to using public transit, _especially_ buses. There's the whole 'independence' issue of things.

As a fag, your comment (unoriginal as it may be) made me think how great it is to be a man (that also happens to be a fag.)  Being a man means not taking the easy way out.

&gt;A society where no one has guns will be awash in crime newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think that's necessarily the case.  As you say, crime rates are IQ-dependent.   newlinechar  newlinechar What about societies that are awash in guns?  There are a number of examples where civil order has collapsed and can't be restored due to the per-capita number of AK47s.

And if all guns were eliminated in the United States we would most likely see a far greater incidence of opportunistic violent crime-- muggings, etc, in addition to such things as happyslapping (largely the province of imports...) newlinechar  newlinechar Switzerland is an example: 100% per-family ownership of Sig550 assault rifles, with gun crime approaching zero per capita. newlinechar  newlinechar Guns are not the problem in the United States.  Race is the problem.  But since race is an absolutely taboo topic, restrictive gun laws may be the only answer-- they also fulfill the US government agenda of monopoly of force and an increasingly disarmed population of cattle. newlinechar  newlinechar Interestingly, gun crime among NRA members also approaches zero, even though, like the Swiss, they are effectively 100% armed. newlinechar  newlinechar In the US, one possibility may be firearms ownership tests that have non-obvious IQ tests built in: lots of bureaucratic paperwork that needs to be filled out might work, with the idea being to keep guns out of the hands of low-IQ individuals but to let smart people have basically whatever they want.

It's important to note that in Parkinson's, the neurons that die off are the dopaminergic ones, i.e. the ones that *produce* dopamine - the vast majority of the ones with dopamine *receptors* are not dopaminergic, and thus they are intact. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: misread post, apologies. newlinechar  newlinechar So what you're dealing with here is someone with low dopaminergic function, and highly upregulated D2 dopamine receptors, and you're giving them a dose of L-DOPA to bring their dopaminergic system's functioning to normal baseline levels. Except that it's already upregulated in limbic areas, and thus this will briefly behave like an 'overdose' until receptor levels renormalize. Until then, the mesolimbic circuit is in a hyperdopaminergic state, which seems to correlate with the state of the mesolimbic circuit in someone with schizophrenia where positive symptoms are both common and prominent. newlinechar  newlinechar I gave some citations for similar claims in my other post.

Multivalues occupy a weird middle ground between [Scheme amb](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node88.html) or the [Haskell list monad](http://www.haskell.org/all_about_monads/html/listmonad.html), and [Orc parallel expressions](http://orc.csres.utexas.edu/tutorial.shtml).  Some of the odd design choices of multivalues: newlinechar  newlinechar * they are not treated the same for all functions, for example [1..3] does not produce the values [1], [2], [3]. newlinechar * it's not clear how they interact with statements -- it sounds like (1,2,3); 'hi' would only evaluate 'hi' once. newlinechar * there are apparently no backtracking operators. newlinechar * they can easily escape an expression to 'contaminate' the stack, forcing functions to be evaluated multiple times unexpectedly. Orc and Lisp, for example, avoid this by requiring you to be explicit about when you want to call a function for each of multiple values, just using the first value otherwise.

A lot of the 'gamers' I know actually prefer to play on CRT monitors since they have better refresh rates than LCD's.  Yeah, you can get 120 Hz LCD's, but you could just spend $50 (or less) for a CRT off Craigslist.  Plus, with a CRT, you can use a much lower resolution, meaning you can get away with lower specs and still have a sharp-looking image.

Far from that. Virtually all people under forty speak some English but many of them caveman-style ('I go evening pub beer.') - enough to get their message across or help out a lost tourist but not enough to have a conversation.

Aww man I just typed this awfully long message and then I accidentally hit the back button I HATE THIS SHIT. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, your info was very useful, thank you for that. I was considering not wasting the visa, but I think I'll have to work to lessen the pressure on my already tight budget.

I'm considering staying 5 months in Australia, 2 working, 3 travelling. Beyond that I'm not really trying to plan anything, Australia seems easier without planning. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, I think the South East Asian trip is going to take me about 2 months.

So if travel buddy = South America, no travel buddy = North America, land on the west coast and then travel through the middle to New York, then back to Frankfurt (maybe Dublin, Scotland, Lisboa, whatever it is as a last place to see in Europe.

Well, if you take terrorism to be the use of violence by a small group on dissidents to impose a course of action over the democratic will, then no they are not.

Eventually, he got me to say there was no one else in the house to ask about this person (stupid, I know... I wasn't fully awake). Immediately his tone changed to very aggressive and told me to not hang up and answer some questions or I would be raped (I'm a girl). I immediately hung up and that was the last of it, but it was highly unnerving.
If I traveled to a country where the native language is not English, I wouldn't *expect* anyone to speak ANY English.  I'd be pleasantly surprised at any English at all that someone could speak, no matter how bad it was.  The fact that I can go to Germany, any Scandinavian country, and Iceland and almost everyone speaks fluent English despite that not being their native tongue is just such a huge bonus for me, I love it, but that's what it is: a *bonus*.  I would never *expect* a German or a Swede to be able to speak English.

Honest answer, not seen it.  Only came out a couple of years ago, right?  I've not watched the film in considerably more than that, but I believe it's substantively a cleaned-up improved version of the Director's Cut? If it is, it may be the one to see.  But Director's over original version with the sappy voice-over and dumb Hollywood ending.
No, it's pertinent because it is the outlyer case.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Many people don't realize that, in the USA, [there is a system-wide discrepancy in sentencing between men and women for the same crimes](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/320276). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is a similar bias against blacks and minorities, but the bias against males is persistent even accounting for skin color.  newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar For example, a man is found guilty of a crime (say, manslaughter) and gets a sentence of 22 years in prison.  A woman is found guilty of the same crime and gets 7-9 years. Why?  Because the court finds aggravating circumstances with the man, to wit: he is a man.  He acted 'agressively' (by being a man).  Or he demonstrated anger (as he has been taught to for his entire life, while a woman is taught to cry when upset). Or some other inevitable gender-based bias.  I know I am speaking in stereotypes, but these are well-earned stereotypes! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This is one case at least where that discrepancy isn't apparent.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a rare case where you see harsh penalties for women teachers for abusing students, while it's common for men teachers to get the book thrown at them for the same.    newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sex-with-your-teacher is something like a high-school boy's fantasy, but it's dangerous and unacceptable regardless of the genders of the people involved and I'm glad to see it being treated seriously.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 13-yr olds should be exploring sex with other 13 yr olds, not with their teachers.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I see your point but for me, at least, the game physics added to the realism: you're slow and lumbering while the splicers are agile; the screen blur caused by a Big Daddy strike makes you panic and mash the heal button more than you should, etc. I had a similarily positive experience with Killzone 2's mechanics. Both games give me a sense of vulnerability. newlinechar  newlinechar BioShock was also the first game I've played that made effective use of *powers*. I first played BioShock when it came out on PS3 - a year after it was released - and had dismissed all of the screenshots I had seen featuring plasmids as a gimmick. Turns out plasmids were more than that and you could not beat the game using guns alone. This was primarily due to the weapons being weak and unbalanced.

Wrong-o.  Insurance companies have all sorts of ways to limit what they will pay on.  They use things like 'surgical schedules' for example.

The mandatory auto insurance thing was a huge giveaway, and the mandatory health insurance push is the biggest giveaway to private industry in this century. newlinechar  newlinechar Their biggest enemy in the auto insurance realm was 'no fault' because it mandated them to PAY regardless of fault. newlinechar  newlinechar Their biggest enemy in the health insurance realm is single payer, because it cuts them out completely.
Awesome, all of you. One of my favorite things about being a neuropsychologist is reading sentences with words like 'hyperdopaminergic' and 'mesolimbic' in them and knowing (mostly!) what they are talking about.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I came to neuropsychology through a slightly atypical path (as I explained somewhere else, more through a lot of training in assessment *before* learning about neuropsychology, and less through having studied neuroscience, neuroanatomy, and neuropsychology in adults *before* learning assessment), so I'm unfortunately fairly 'self-taught' in my neuroscience and neuroanatomic knowledge, and there are some glaring gaps in what I know.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What is it that you do/are studying?

&gt; So why does the author choose to write out a thoughtful, logical argument for a specific theme of racism and white guilt? newlinechar  newlinechar Because it's about a white guy teaming up with natives who paint their face and wear feathers. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not exactly a stretch to say it recapitulates the Dances with Wolves story. newlinechar  newlinechar You're basically trying to squirm out of the idea, there.

Call her and go through the usual 'how are things? You liking &lt;hobby&gt;? How about &lt;job&gt;?' song and dance. Then wait until she's giving a long and emotional reply to something, maybe about a lost boyfriend or job where she was made redundant, and casually mention that you've got a large penis. newlinechar  newlinechar She's going to say something akin to 'what?', to which you must reply 'I didn't say anything. I was just listening to your story', and with any luck she's going to shrug it off as something from her subconscious.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ask her to go on with the story, wait until she reaches the point at which you feel she's most vulnerable, and then casually say 'I have a massive penis.' When she asks if you said something, say 'no?' in a confused voice and ask her to go on. If she's done with the story, ask her something that's going to get her slightly hot and bothered like 'Hey sis, what was it like when you lost your virginity?' or 'Hey sis, what's your take on anal sex?' newlinechar  newlinechar As she's going through this, her voice is going to start to be a bit shakey. This is because she's aroused, and it's an opportune time to say 'If I had a Mexican person nearby, they could use my penis as a gardening tool. It's that ginormous.'  newlinechar  newlinechar She's convinced that you didn't actually say that, and she's so horny that the mere mention of it will drive her over the edge.

Just because David Icke doesn't say that reptilians did 9/11 doesn't mean that they didn't. newlinechar  newlinechar All joking aside, this is an important point and one that many if not most popular campaigns depend on: any group debating for one side or another must be divisible by emotionally weighted arguments. newlinechar  newlinechar *Asking questions about 9/11?* You're taking the terrorist side.

The land was given to Israel by god, who are you to go against god's word? newlinechar  newlinechar *Asking questions about the occupation?* You're shaming all the soldiers who gave their lives fighting to liberate those lands from oppression.

This article is so true.  It always is the end of the world as we know it, and for many younger people the world must look like a pretty dark place with a scary future.  My 13 year old daughter is obsessed with the 2012 doomsday predictions.  All my logic and thoughtful conversations have barely made a dent in her illogical concerns.  But then I remember being 13 years old and walking home from school looking up in the sky to see if a Cuban missile was going to wipe out Philadelphia and me with it. I was petrified.  But  here's what I am trying to tell my daughter now and it seems to be working.  Throughout the entire recorded history of humanity, somewhere on this planet some society or culture, was always advancing our knowledge base.  Even in the Dark Ages of Europe, the Moors and Chinese continued to advance.  Eventually everyone catches up.   We have a lot of problems; global climate changes, diseases, intolerance, lack of corporate responsibility, ineffective and seemingly unresponsive governments, ineffective educational institutions and such.  The list seems never ending.  My generation (60's and 70's) had  every one of these same problems.  Some got solved a little, some became worse, but through it all we continued to advance our science, our medicine, and our information distribution systems. There are more scientists, engineers, and doctors alive and working today, than there have been in the entire combined history of the human race before this time.   We will solve the climate problems, overpopulation, famine, poor education, energy, disease. All these things will happen, perhaps and very likely in the life span of  most young redditors.  It's an amazing time to be alive.   The mission for the current generation and perhaps for the next two or three generations, is to to learn how to resolve human conflict without force, without threats, without killing and without war.    When that happens, when science, math, medicine, engineering and peaceful resolution come together in most world societies, our species will then be on the fore edge of a golden age.  Coming out of the past ten years, as bad as they seemed at times, that's my hope for the future and the hope I wish to instill in my daughter.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Okay, I'll meet your anecdotal evidence with mine. I work in an extended stay hotel, and I can reasonably say that many of the folks that stay with us would not if they were not assured that no one has smoked in the room previously. When people smoke in our rooms, we have to bring in cleaners with specific equipment and we usually can't sell the room for a couple of nights - because a majority of our guests will not sleep in them. And we respect their wishes - we would rather send someone with a reservation to our hotel to a different hotel (at no small expense to us) than to a room in our hotel that smells like smoke. This happened at our hotel not more than a week ago (and a guest was forced to travel an extra 20 minutes or so) because we only had rooms available that smelled like smoke. newlinechar  newlinechar Hotels that allow smoking tend to be cheaper, and therefore have less trouble filling rooms in times of economic troubles. Most American hotels are experiencing economic troubles right now, but this does not mean that allowing smoking in the rooms would 'fix' any hotels. I haven't been to Niagra Falls in ten years or so, but hotels around Niagra Falls are not representative of the industry as a whole. My hotel isn't representative of the industry either, but I can say that it isn't as simple as smoking/non-smoking.

I had a friend that lost all 3 of her dogs in a 3 month period of time.  The first one went to splenic cancer, a month later one went to mast cell cancer, and then about 3 weeks later, the last one went to heart failure. newlinechar  newlinechar She never had any kids, so her dogs were her kids.  Actually, the last one is the one that hurt my heart the worst.  When he got to where he couldn't hardly move around, I would drive about 60 miles every other day to go visit him, and I would take him treats and toys.  His favorite was a little lamb shaped squeaky toy that I had gotten for him, and even though he ripped the squeaky out within 15 minutes of my giving it to him, he carried it everywhere, and when he went to sleep, he would rest it on top of his front paws, and then rest his chin on top of it. Even when he was euthed, he had it with him. newlinechar  newlinechar She kind of went nuts after that, not that I blame her.  But she became vicious enough towards everyone, that I really didn't care to be around her anymore, either. newlinechar  newlinechar I will say this.  When you have one dog and lose it...  it hurts a lot more than when you have 3 dogs and only lose one.

Happy New Years (I'm drunk!) newlinechar  newlinechar It depends on how you define rationality and irrationality. Personally, I think the terms are fairly loaded, so I'm not a big fan of using them. newlinechar  newlinechar On the topic of bubbles though, they're definitely things that do exist in the real world. There's plenty of experimental evidence for bubbles in controlled markets and even 'rational' models (ones that assume Bayesian and sophisticated agents) can produce bubbles (ask me later for references). However, it is really hard to tell ex-ante what is and what isn't a bubble (I think the housing bubble was obvious, but I don't know, I'm a theorist!). newlinechar  newlinechar I think the policy implications are very complicated, we should definitely question the wisdom of 'the market' because it's obvious that it's not always right. Markets do happen to do a *damn good* job of aggregating individual information, but they're not perfect, how to actually balance these things... well, that's a very long question. There are very many circumstances where they can fail and we should try to figure out when those are but as far as the theory goes, I think we're very very far from a good understanding of bubble formation. newlinechar  newlinechar I do think that the government should pop things that look like bubbles more often, but, like I said, I'm a micro guy and don't know much about finance or macro. In general, I think we should probably regulate the markets more to ensure stability and redundancy as opposed to 'efficiency.'

You know, I wondered if that was it. I agree that Paul has his head up his ass, but I have to disagree about John. He was funny, laid back and interesting, as well as confident, extroverted and a bit eccentric - which I reckon (along with Yoko's influence) is the reason for his occasionally weird behaviour (honeymoon bed-in, shitty concept albums and so on). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You should watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0uQlxCx89U) documentary on youtube.

Sure, Matthew Rabin has many models of 'irrational' agents. Again, it depends on what you mean by rationality and in many ways the 'rational actor' framework of traditional econ is definitely rich enough to incorporate many behavioral biases (for example, assuming that agents don't weigh incoming information heavily enough or react to information that confirms their beliefs more than information that disconfirms them.) newlinechar  newlinechar Longer version: Rationality in economics just means that agents have preferences and a view of the world and act in a way to bring the world 'more in line' with their preferences. There is no reason that a 'rational' agent can't have 'irrational' tendencies if we happen to write them into that agent's preferences or into the way that agent misperceives the world.

Thank you. It seems the like the people who claim to be interested in equality are often the ones who keep pointing out the differences between people.

All the people who are opposed to this verdict on Reddit are scaring me with visions of the Salem witch trials. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondhand accounts are flimsy at best, especially when the emotions of supposed cold-blooded murder come into play. If someone sees something that they believe to be murder, they are prone to subconsciously warping the story (or just plain lying) any which way that backs up their viewpoints. newlinechar  newlinechar Criminal rights is an integral part of the justice system, you can't just tear them down because a certain percentage of people get off on it. You might think it's full of shit and lacks common sense, but who is to say which cases are able to allow for common sense to subjugate people's criminal rights? I say we give them to every defendant and call it a day. newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing to note is that the prosecution made mistakes by relying their cases (seemingly) so heavily on these sworn statements, but I'm sure that this case will be studied front and back and then summarized and analyzed by Law students worldwide, such that this mistake will be much less likely to ever happen in the future.

I would suggest giving her a back rub to relax her.  Take your time with her and try to just focus on her body and forget yourself.  Treat her like she is a goddess and you are worshiping her body.  When she is getting close to climax you slowly penetrate her.  Then slowly rub her ass massaging her cheeks inward and go really slow so she can feel everything.  Go so slow that you can rub your hands up and down her back to the rhythm of your thrusts.  If you want to speed up then wait until she starts getting loud.  Also try to breathe very slowly this is a very old technique to keep focus.  My boyfriend does all these things and he is the best lover I have ever had so believe me it works.

Austrians say that inevitably in these situations, the manufacturing and business contraction will reach down into the consumption stages of production, at which point it will be 'officially' declared by leaders that the economy has hit the skids. newlinechar  newlinechar If this had been a barter economy then I would probably agree with your story. (perishable goods must be used or traded on) Trouble is: It isn't. Spending is influenced by many things (confidence), not only the last salary. That is where your story breaks down. newlinechar  newlinechar What is worse: people run in herds, so it is possible for an entire economy to be stuck in a bad equilibrium with insufficient demand. Government has to step in to fill the gap.

You're also neglecting the possibility that piracy raised awareness of the movie and increased profit. newlinechar  newlinechar An argument for piracy would be something along the lines of getting back at big corporations or only downloading abandonware because the original creator isn't getting any profit anymore.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the argument for most file sharing in general go something like: If you are stolen from, you have one less than you should have and they have one more than they should have. If you share something and let someone copy it, you have the same amount as you should have and they have one more than they should have. You're adding, not subtracting. You let more people see your work and use it. newlinechar  newlinechar File sharing is intertwined with the concept of Open Source and Free Software. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: http://labs.timesonline.co.uk/blog/2009/11/12/do-music-artists-do-better-in-a-world-with-illegal-file-sharing/ newlinechar  newlinechar (In the UK:) According to BPI there doesn't seem to be a correlation between the rise of piracy (not shown on the graphs) and loss of overall revenue.

It's great.

I know a lot of people complain that it is hard to hold, but they are doing it wrong. Here's the right way to do it. Put your hand on your desk, with your fingers in a relaxed curve, so that there is a volume above your desk that is caged in by your fingers. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Put the Magic Mouse in that volume. Keeping your fingers relaxed, slowly close your hand until you've got a light grip on the edges of the mouse. You can now easily mouse around by moving your still relaxed hand around.

What I think is interesting is how every time boobs are mentioned in a link/comment thread/whatever in one of the more male-dominated sub-reddits (i.e. any but this one), there is always some girl asking if it's okay that she has small boobs, and if it's possible that men will still be attracted to her. Most Reddit men have made it clear time and again that they love small boobs, and definitely prefer them over the huge ones (big areolas! gross!). It's almost as if those women (not all, but some) just want to be reminded how many men would do them if they could. Whenever I read this my ego can't help but be a little wounded. This was always my consolation: I may not be a stick, but at least I've got nice boobs! Seems to me that while, for a time men seemed to prefer more 'natural' women to the impossibly thin movie stars and models, that trend is changing, and expectations are becoming increasingly hard to meet.

A lot of Hollywood movies don't make much money or even recoup their budget. Which is why we have an endless supply of unoriginal franchises and sequels.

He says what things?  Like I've said, he's been very consistent with what he's advocated or and what he thought would happen (which has been fairly accurate).  You're making an unfounded assumption about what Krugman would claim if something that hasn't happen does.   newlinechar  newlinechar Right now, he credits the (poorly managed) TARP and stimulus for preventing the second Great Depression.  However, he warns that the stimulus wasn't enough, that the [benefits from the spending have peaked](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/stimulus-timing/), and that unless another stimulus/job creation bill is done that we could face a Japan style lost decade and possibly a [double dip](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/double-dip-warning/).  If they don't do another stimulus and we have a fast recovery or they do another stimulus and we still go into a deep recession, he will be wrong.  Not exactly covering his bases.

They wrote the Constitution*.    newlinechar  newlinechar *From the BBC* newlinechar &gt;Military rule, corruption, a huge wealth gap, crime and natural disasters have rendered Honduras one of the least developed and least secure countries in Central America. newlinechar Until the mid-1980s Honduras was dominated by the military, which enthusiastically supported US efforts to stem revolutionary movements in the region. newlinechar Since then, civilian leaders have sought to curb the power of the military - with varying degrees of success. newlinechar Some **army officers have been charged with human rights abuses, but many have still to be prosecuted for violations committed in the 1980s**. newlinechar  newlinechar *And you trust the army over this guy? because he wanted to amend the consitution that the army wrote? He wantes to do away with the 4 year term limit? Thats your justification?* newlinechar

Internet sarcasm is difficult to detect, so I will respond to this question as though it is serious, as it may well be: multiplayer exists only in the fact that, after you've beaten all of the levels, the only thing that keeps you playing (and if you're anything like me, it certainly will keep you playing) is that you're comparing your times against those of everyone else. It's a dangerously addicting system, though, and you will spend a looong time perfecting your runs to maximize your time.

Oh absolutely it's bizarre, and that's why people love it. It's not for everyone, and the people that enjoy it do so for a lot of reasons, but I think there's a nearly universal attraction to seeing someone do something that one would never want or be able to do themselves. I think a lot of people just want to see something go horribly wrong as well! newlinechar  newlinechar Sideshow is about a lot more than pain but addressing just that aspect, I have an interest in pain. I like to push the limits of what I'm capable of - that applies to my interest in cycling as well as the show. I can't fully explain it.

I'm not a fan of that either, but there's not much else that can be done.  You can't exactly throw the girl out into the streets and the family can't do anything else.  I am open to any other ideas that would be better while respecting the contract. newlinechar  newlinechar The home owner's association is being a huge dick in enforcing the contract, but they have that right.  Would you rather the government have the power to nullify arbitrary private contracts. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that the hoa should also have to pay some of the cost to enforce the contract.  Once you make them foot the bill, I bet they'd be a little less eager to carry through.

The issue I have is that the entire case was built upon subjective witness testimony. It was essentially one half of town saying the defendant did it and the other half saying he didn't. When I saw that a case with absolutely no real evidence went to trial like this, I was just livid. newlinechar  newlinechar How do you convict someone for a severe charge such as murder and have absolutely no proof? There actually isn't any evidence to suggest the victim is even dead. Also some of the defense witness testimony directly contradicts the prosecution's testimony. Therefore, the jury obviously held the prosecution's witnesses in higher regard and totally ignored the defense's testimony. If I were on that jury, without being shown any evidence, I would be forced to acquit. I'm not going to convict someone simply because someone told me they did something.
&gt;His mother and the older ladies of the town think that he has been possessed by the devil and take him to church to exorcise the 'demons.' His father however understands that he is suffering from sexual hunger and takes him to a brothel. newlinechar  newlinechar Great parenting there.  
I know that MLA used to require it but it was updated in (I believe) the early 2000's as I began with MLA in 2003 and it didn't require it. I know that APA, Chicago and MLA don't require it, and as much as I know, those are the most widely used in Arts. I wrote both my undergrad and graduate theses in APA and didn't require it. The profs I've had have always been strict with format, to the point that I can usually write works cited in those three formats without looking to a style manual. This was in Canada, though - I can't say what the requirements are in other places. Just interesting though as I've never ever heard of this before! Someone said above, though, that it's required both in law papers and armed forces reports. Interesting!

From [Wikipedia's article on the Emperor Shōwa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito#The_Sino-Japanese_War_and_World_War_II): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; According to Akira Fujiwara, the Emperor personally ratified the proposal by the Japanese Army to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5. newlinechar  newlinechar What this means is that there was genocide, for sure. But there was also forced slavery, forced sexual slavery, displacement of people throughout Asia, not only in China, but also in Korea and in other places where the Japanese invaded. Hirohito and his army weren't constrained by a particular race or religious view, as were the Nazis. [Some estimates put the Japanese body count at 10,000,000 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes). newlinechar  newlinechar So, Hirohito was, at least as bad as Hitler. However, Hirohito continued to rein after the war, his son is the current Emperor of Japan. And no one ever talks about the Japanese war crimes. I would say that this is worse than those names that have already been punished by a war tribunal (or, at the very least, punished by history), since Hirohito hasn't been punished in any way.

It's in the SMTP specs that if a message is temporarily denied, the sending server is supposed to retry a few times at a later date. newlinechar  newlinechar It works because real SMTP servers obey the rule, and SPAM servers don't because of the additional time and money to try resending spam.  The only downside is the 30min+ delay in time for the first time an email comes through from a new sender.

IIRC Julian Seward, author of bzip2, employed a very similar method when he librarized the utility. I think it was about a fairly complex loop that consumed single bits at various places in the loop body. While it was in an application, it was free to block in any such bit consumption operation if no more input was currently available. When it became a library, it had to be able to return to the caller and pick up later at the same place. newlinechar  newlinechar Thankfully, instead of turning to `longjmp()` and co., he replaced the bit retrieval operation with a macro that generates a case label for later continuation, and that -- if no new bit (byte) is available -- saves all local state into a caller-owned structure and returns. A stroke of genius. That is my understanding, at least. newlinechar  newlinechar We shall be thankful for how the C language was invented. Crudely put, `switch` is a selection statement that jumps to 'immediately enclosed' `case` labels that can be placed *anywhere* in the `switch` body. (By the stupid wording 'immediately enclosed' I mean `case` labels that are not also enclosed within an enclosed `switch`). The following steps might be helpful in interpreting Duff's Device: newlinechar  newlinechar * Write up a version without the `switch` statement and the `case` labels. newlinechar * Determine useful entry points and put a `case` label there. newlinechar * Enclose them in a `switch` selection statement while keeping nesting correct.

&gt; There is no reason that a 'rational' agent can't have 'irrational' tendencies if we happen to write them into that agent's preferences or into the way that agent misperceives the world. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Doesn't that make the whole definition of 'rational' pointless then? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Not to put too fine a point on it, but call a pig a pig. If mainstream economics doesn't want to admit humans aren't rational, despite the loads of psychology research that shows we have cognitive biases galore, there is a _big_ problem.

&gt;my friends and me newlinechar  newlinechar It's hilarious that people are upvoting this comment.  It goes to show that redditors just like the *idea* of correcting grammar.

It's a sentence fragment, you can't just insert words that *make* it wrong, and *then* say it's wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Part of me wants to wax nostalgic and say that I remember a time when reddit thought before downvoting, but that's probably bullshit.

'They' are the people who defend piracy by using false analogy. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'other' model is reality. Don't make the assumption that anything sold has to be a physical item and the nonsense of the pirates' position becomes apparent.

The problem with the system of education concerning WWII in American 'World History' classes, is that Germany/Austria is seen as being a completely Nazi country after the disintegration of the Bundestag up until the end of the war. The education concerning the resistance groups (White Rose &amp; Sophie Scholl, von Stauffenberg, etc) isn't there, and at least in my World History class it was never addressed that Adolf Hitler was born in Austria. Thus, most Americans immediately make the association of Germany with Hitler. newlinechar  newlinechar The other historical factors concerning Germany's actions (the financial crisis, the rise of the NSDAP, etc) and the factors leading up to the dictatorship, such as the Ermächtigungsgesetz, simply aren't being taught to our young ones. For this reason, we see things like the Bush administration expanding Executive powers, and nobody seems to care. Much like the Reichstag fire in '33, we had an 'outside attack' (still a widely debated topic) on 9/11. But instead of demonizing the Jews for trying to destroy our country, the USA has used Muslims as scapegoats. newlinechar  newlinechar Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.

Read 'Here, there, and everywhere'. It's by the guy who actually recorded almost all of the Beatles' albums and therefore had a very good idea of what the heck he was talking about. John was alright at the beginning of their career, but towards the end he became a huge prick, and pretty much insane. He had Yoko in the studio for everything (which is a huge no no in music biz, it kills the flow), and even brought in a damned BED in which she lay in a nightgown and a tiara for the recording of an album. A bed. In the studio.  I also don't understand the George love here...he was a pretty shoddy guitarist until late in the band's career, learned to be a pretty good songwriter at around the same time, but wasn't exactly the nicest guy either (according to the book). Why does everyone think Paul has his head up his ass...? He made/makes great music, does a lot of charity work, and doesn't come off as an asshole at all in interviews. John did, and he was apparently a huge jerk (again, from the book, but I think that's a little more reliable than documentaries that focus solely on Lennon.) 
I think they're all about the same size.  The two on the right have a very flattering pose, one is covering the curve of her hip with an arm, and the other is covering it with another model.  This makes both of them look like they have smaller hips.  The two on the left aren't hiding anything.  Since this is a plus size photo shoot to show how plus size can be beautiful, calling some of the models too plus size seems to defeat the entire purpose.

I'm being honest.  I came from a solidly middle-class family of five.  My parents had a combined income of around 100K.  Now, I live off 650 dollars per month.

The bankers and CEOs responsible are people.

A lot of individual actors (banks, traders, securities guys) aimed at maximizing their own returns. The system is so massive that guys felt they were disconnected from the real world. The numbers flying across the screens stopped being physical entities (like mortgages), but rather abstract concepts viewed through the bottom line.

If plus size models were photographed in such a sexy, yet tasteful way for all advertising campaigns selling plus size clothing, I think it would be a great success.

Proportions change. The same thing that's a perfect fit at size 6 goes wonky at size 16 if it's just made larger with the cut unchanged. Showing actual plus-sized models wearing a product would help plus-size buyers see that it will actually fit them well (like those Guess jeans, nice!) and shooting them in a sexy way would demonstrate that a bigger lady will be a HOTTIE in the product.

Until baryluk responds, I'll give it a try. newlinechar  newlinechar     #define if(cond, ...) __trace_if( (cond , ## __VA_ARGS__) ) newlinechar  newlinechar First, they define `if()` as a variadic macro. Sometimes people use the comma operator, for example to sequence multiple assignments or function calls within the controlling expression. Example: newlinechar  newlinechar     if (set_a(&amp;a), set_b(&amp;b), a &lt; b) { newlinechar       ... newlinechar     } newlinechar  newlinechar They make use of a [GNU preprocessor extension](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros), namely `, ##__VA_ARGS__`. In the end, they are able to use or not use the comma operator in the controlling expressions passed to `if()` and passed on to `__trace_if()`. newlinechar  newlinechar Second, the `__trace_if()` macro uses the [gcc extension](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html) `({})`. It allows to use a compound statement in place of an expression. The last expression evaluated in the compound statement becomes the value of the parenthesized compound statement. newlinechar  newlinechar [\_\_builtin\_constant\_p](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-g_t_005f_005fbuiltin_005fconstant_005fp-2868) determines *if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that value*. If `cond` is known to be constant at compile time, then there's little use in collecting statistics for this `if()`. In this case, `!!(cond)` simply returns the 'truth' value (`0` or `1`) of `cond`. (An equivalent formulation would have been `0 != (cond)`.) newlinechar  newlinechar If the controlling expression is not known to be a compile-time constant, they initialize (once) some members of a static structure with special placement via a gcc extension ([designated initializers](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.2/gcc/Designated-Inits.html) -- something similar appeared in C99). The values used for (static) initialization tie the counter to the location within the source code, ie. they identify which `if()` we're talking about when gathering the stats later. newlinechar  newlinechar They then evaluate the controlling expression like written above. Depending on the truth value, either the element with index 0 or the element with index 1 of the `miss_hit` structure member array is incremented. Finally, the truth value is returned as the value of the whole expression, so that the real `if` statement can work.

Yeah, that's great and a noble goal.  But the way to accomplish it is not to ignore the sexual, racial, and other divisions that still exist in the present day.
Pressure groups exert power far beyond a group's numbers, and Muslim sympathizers who establish sex segregation, Sharia courts, and downgrade other weak groups' civil rights (gays, women) can have a bigger impact than 5%.

Kinda, but not totally.

When the last election was held, like the one before, the outcome was exactly as predicted. So why then didn't NDP voters vote strategically for the Liberal party, for instance? newlinechar  newlinechar The reason is that your left/right wing bifurcation is simlistic sophistry. It's a myth purveyed by people who think that there's the conservatives, and then 'everyone else' suffering from horrible vote splitting.  newlinechar  newlinechar In reality the Liberals have been just as centrist as the Conservatives for years, and a very good portion of Liberal voters (especially in Ontario outside of the center of Toronto) would vote Hitler Prime Minister before they would allow the NDP to govern. In Quebec the toss up was between people flipping between the BQ and the Conservatives, again shooting down your 'progressives' argument. If anything the only strategic voting was by voters who wanted the Conservatives to have a minority, but still felt uncomfortable with a majority (whenever majority predictions came up, Conservative support would ease back) newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Though if Harper wouldn't have made the incredible arts funding blunder (where he said that Canadians don't support paying for rich people to have arts galas, which of course was paraphrased into 'Canadians don't like the arts!'), the Conservatives would have easily carried Quebec. That single blunder cost them a clear majority. newlinechar  newlinechar Put this in your pipe and think about it -- despite the 2/3rd 'majority', when polled on whether they wanted a coalition, the majority of Canadians said no way. It turns out that BQ voters didn't want the Liberals having the reigns of power, nor did the Liberals want the BQ to have considerable pull, or anyone allowing the NDP to call the shots. Despite this 'majority', most were more comfortable with the Conservatives continuing their run. newlinechar  newlinechar Kind of funny that. It turns out it isn't quite as simple. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be interesting if our votes allowed for a 'second choice' that would be weighted into the results. I suspect the results would differ dramatically from your analysis.

Wow. I am a woman who feels very hurt when my boyfriend jerks off to porn. I am reasonable and fulfill his needs but he says it's just something he's done since before he knew me and if I knew 'what it was really like' I wouldn't be hurt. But I am. It's hurts deep in my chest to imagine him thinking about another girl when I have a great body and give me great sex. Would you or anyone else mind elaborating, if you can, on what it's really like to watch porn for a guy? Like.. why is it so necessary? And why can't you just think about your girlfriend if she is hot? Why is it so difficult? Thanks.
No, as waffles said earlier. People just don't 'give' money for an organization, people like to see some sort of action being done, and in this case playing video games works.

I would agree that you are drinking over the recommended weekly amount for an adult.

This may be old news...to be honest I've never bothered to read a single thing about this bombing story since it occurred.  But this seems to be an important piece of news, if only because this American's suspicions, and his willingness to declare them openly, are almost certainly the product of the anti-Establishment cultural trend that has escalated since 9/11.  In other words, it may be a sign that in the future, people caught up in these kinds of events may be more willing to believe their own eyes than to accept the 'official stories' that they're told to accept.

This is, of course, an opinionated argument. I myself prefer the original release. While I respect Scott's vision, and I have an appreciation for the director's cut, the people who originally changed his movie to make it a little bit more palatable had a better idea of what would be liked by the masses. Which only makes sense, I'm sure at the time of the release of Blade Runner, Scott's producers had more experience at releasing movies that made money than he did. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as explaining things better, I'm not trying to cause friction with you, but I find it strange that you felt a movie without voice-overs explained more than the same movie released with them. I also find it a bit humorous, because that's why the production company put the voice-overs in to begin with. They felt the movie was less amorphous with them. Without them you have less of an idea of what's going on in the movie, because the information you're being fed is lessened without them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and the difference in cut scenes on the movie amounted to a 3 minute increase in running time in the 1992 version, and 4 minutes extra running time in the 2007 version. And I, like the production company, felt the one major scene that added the bulk of that time (The dream sequence in his apartment while Rachel played the piano) was... unnecessary. Plus gotta admit it, I miss the happy ending. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But in the end it all comes down to preference.

I've had a similar experience, but I can pinpoint why. I started taking this Chinese herbal appetite suppressant and, after a week or so of use, my orgasms started to last longer. I had quit using it for about two months, and my orgasms went back to normal. Sure enough, things changed again once I started using once more. Anyway, I guess the moral of the story is: If they put that shit as a side effect on the box they'd sell better. newlinechar  newlinechar (I should probably add that it does its job as an appetite suppressant, too.)

I'm under the impression that history class in American schools is very u.s.-centric... correct me if I'm wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from the two world wars I didn't learn about 'recent' (let's say 1800-now) German history until I was in an advanced history class in 12th and 13th grade (in Germany you have to pick 2 courses to focus on during these years). And even that was more about all the secret diplomacy going on in Europe and the events that eventually lead up to WW1. The rest was ancient Greece, Egypt, the roman empire, China, America...

Agreed, companies look and react to piracy in completely the wrong way and it is themselves that suffer for it. newlinechar  newlinechar eg: i bought Red Faction Guerilla on steam the other day and a friend of mine pirated it. The pirated copy was downloaded pretty quickly, came with the new patch that fixed alot of bugs and was off playing in a matter of minutes. newlinechar  newlinechar I on the other hand had to: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Install Games for Windows. newlinechar 2) Register and make an account for Games for Windows newlinechar 3) Log in and have Games for Windows fail to download and update my game version automatically. newlinechar 4) Had to install another 3rd party program to open the manually downloaded patch (which i had to hunt for), this in turn forced me to install a in game voice chat program and also if i didnt pay attention would have installed another freaking browser toolbar. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally after 3 and a half hours i could play.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem isnt piracy in my opinion, in fact piracy is actually giving companies a clear indication on what the customer wants. If they weren't so damned greedy, manipulative and stubborn by treating already paying customers like thieves, they might find out what the customer really wants. newlinechar  newlinechar If they release Star Trek online on a pay to download site in HD at the same time as the release of the film in the cinema they would recoup 'losses' there.  newlinechar  newlinechar If they stopped forcing people to go through long winded registration and stopped treating law abiding, paying customers like shit, they'd get some 'losses' back there. newlinechar  newlinechar I pirate, not because its free (well not always, hell if I'm paying a grand for the adobe suite), but because I will get less aggravation and I will get it right away.  newlinechar  newlinechar Valve do indeed have the right idea with games.

You raise great points.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Many professionals are all too willing to tell people that if nothing 'medical' is found on some test, then it is all in the person's head. Worse, they convey to the person the idea that if it had been a 'medical' issue, that would have been okay, but since it's clearly a 'psychological' issue, the person must be crazy. (Which, of course, is ridiculous. The brain is not some 'separate' part outside of the body - myriad things that affect the body will also affect the most important body part (the brain), and a lot of things that affect the brain also affect other body systems.)  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Conversion disorders are tricky, because they are both frequently underdiagnosed *and* overdiagnosed. Many people are told it's 'in their head' when there is something medically wrong, and others are told it's a medical issue when it's probably not. And it is complicated by the interrelationships between the brain and the body, so that many people experience both medical and 'psychological' symptoms... for instance, when I'm sick, my knowledge of being sick depresses my attitude, and I can just tell that my 'psychological' state is making the experience of being sick worse.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In my current job, I find myself focusing less on whether the child's condition is 'medically' or 'psychologically' based... I don't care. I want to figure out what is leading to the distress and how I can point the family in a direction that will make that go away. Often, that might involve going to talk to a therapist even when the child clearly has a 'medical' issue, and I frequently refer for further medical work up even if the child has something that looks 'psychological.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I'm sure there are times when I make mistakes, and make people feel like it's 'in their head' when there's probably something medical that I missed. I try to take time to reflect on my mistakes as well, not just my successes, so that I do better next time, and maybe you have taught some valuable lessons to your treatment providers (unfortunately for you, after they had already made you feel angry or miserable).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There **is** starting to be some outrage in medical circles about this exact issue that you're talking about. For instance, have you read Jerome Groopman's *How Doctors Think*? The book outlines how, and why, doctors make mistakes, and what we as a (broad) profession should be doing to prevent, and learn from, these mistakes.

&gt; but being a woman is more than mere appearances. newlinechar  newlinechar Okay, then what are the criteria for being a woman that male-to-female transsexuals do not typically meet? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a dwarf had surgery to become 6', he/she would STILL be a dwarf. Why? A 'dwarf' means someone with dwarfism, a medical disease, not that the person is short. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty sure transsexuals usually accept that they are genetically the opposite sex of whichever they transitioned into, so I don't see the issue. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, the hypothetical dwarf with surgery is still a dwarf.  But it would be silly to call them short.  Likewise, when a person dedicates their life to becoming the sex they identify with, has all sorts of surgery, therapy, and treatments, I don't have a problem with considering them to be the sex they identify with.

Well, actually they (if it's 4chan who did that) teached him a valuable lesson.

I guess you could say the result is the kid should always have legal attachment to whoever's genetic material it has, so I kind of follow the logic, but I still think this is wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar We know however that we violate that norm all the time with adoption. The difference I see at least with the scenario of an accidental pregnancy is that the man engages in that act knowing that accidents happen and he can be held responsible as much as the mother for that accident, since he had equal participation in the act. Either party could say 'No, we're not going to risk making babies.' newlinechar  newlinechar In this case, the man gives his sperm knowing full well that a child will be made for another couple, not him, and the couple knew that as well. The knowledge set in these cases are different. No one goes to a sperm bank looking for a whole father to come with, that's the point of the thing.

Actually, 'to be' is one of the only verbs in English that doesn't take a direct-object pronoun when it's reflexive. Technically, 'I am I' is the most correct. But these grammatical rules were invented in the 19th century by Latinophile poseurs. In reality, English, like most languages without a central authority (in opposition to say, French), has no fixed grammar. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why, when you answer the phone, you say, 'This is s/he.' newlinechar  newlinechar The only grammar that matters is the grammar used by the intellectual elite, if all you're afraid of is 'sounding dumb.' The only grammar that matters in English is what seems correct to your target audience. This is why most people who correct other people's grammar, unless it's egregiously mangled (and you're thus doing them a favor), just seem like assholes. newlinechar  newlinechar **Edit:** It's amazing that we're all being mass-downvoted for stating simple facts about grammar. I guess that this proves my point that grammar is defined not linguistically but by popular opinion.

The neat thing about a support group is that you see those people on a regular basis.

I've always thought the reason the online games didn't want the money to have value outside of the game is because then they would become banks, and subject to the onerous banking regulations; and it would be no fun to have to keep reserves for every gold coin you are allowed to spawn in the game. It would slow down growth: adding a new server would require not only the physical cost of the server but a financial obligation equal to the reserve value of all the treasure you are planning to spawn. newlinechar  newlinechar In some ways this is a good metaphor for why it is difficult for an economy to grow with a gold standard: it's far easier for a central banker to flip a switch and mandate that new money was found than for people to have to be fortunate and find it.

On the other hand, HoN has a straight port of many Heroes and items, and the main map as well, with slight changes to some and the addition of new content.

&gt; Problem 1: Where did the 'cheap' money come from? (Hint: it wasn't the GSEs) newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, I know. The cheap money mostly really started ramping up from Greenspan's rate cuts to facilitate a bubble after the tech sector collapse. It does predate and postdate that though, but that's the real moment they had to do the right thing, if I had to pin it down. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 2: Does that include FHA and Katherine Harris's program as well? Otherwise, it seems partisan rather than logical.  newlinechar  newlinechar That and more. They are still doing things arguably more destructive than even the democratic goals.

I'm not aiming for perfect grades, my parents know that, and they too just want me to reach above average grades. newlinechar  newlinechar As for my lack of friends...I assume you're also an introvert. I am, but I'm somehow good at studying so I just looked for resources that would help me learn socialize. It worked nicely, I would say. I recommend 'How to win friends and influence people' by dale carnegie. newlinechar  newlinechar I also struggled with acne. What I realized was that you don't necessarily have to fault yourself for something you can't control (your hormones). Just do your best not to abuse yourself, and if you can, drink lots of water and get proper sleep and maybe work out a few times a week for 15 minutes. Acne definitely goes away if you begin to ignore it, but at the same time accept it as a part of yourself, in the same way you don't really notice the back of your ear unless you try noticing it. Like how you just noticed it now when I made that comparison. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck buddy

Nowhere in the Koran does it explicity or implicitly state that killing innocent people is alright or allowed, even non-believers, for whatever reason. NOWHERE. newlinechar  newlinechar The violence the Koran describes largely comes from the period of the time, where there were very aggressively competing pagan and Christian groups in the area. The killing of unbelievers/pagans was commanded at certain times, yes, but they were direct, specific commands. It was a time of war, specifically led and decreed in text from god. Christians still had shit like the Crusades and the Inquisition, and both required an incredibly liberal interpretation of the Bible's text. So despite the events described in the Koran, you can't go from that to thinking you can strap a bomb to yourself and fuck up a plane of unsuspecting westerners. From my understanding, you are to treat people with respect and of course, ideally convert them, but not wish harm against them (unless it was  directly commanded by god, or if they threaten or tempt you to deny god, etc). newlinechar  newlinechar The Bible has it's own ways to be 'interpreted' for a fanatic to kill people. And they, like this bomber, easily blur the lines between an apostate (which if you'll read Deutronomy was a guarenteed death sentence), a 'non-believer', and a 'denier', then take lines from their book which required context to make sense (the same 'context' that the bible would require, otherwise we'd all be avoiding shellfish to this day or fucking our sisters). And while I think it's still a bunch of hogwash and senseless violence, once I understand the context, I can understand the messages are would still be relevant to today's era. newlinechar  newlinechar It's your ignorance that paints such a cut and dry, black and white picture of the koran and of islam. When truth be told, the majority of Muslims are peaceful and wouldn't wish harm on an innocent non-believer. You're thinking like the extremists. You obviously don't know many Muslims, if any. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's a tip. Talk to a few real muslims who are knowledgable about their religion, and you'll find that islam, like christianity, isn't based on having the holy book shoved up your ass and followed to the letter, regardless of context.

Avatar Cryer's Anonymous, Group hug! newlinechar  newlinechar Related story: I also went to watch it a second time, and I hardened myself to not cry, and intentionally sat at the end of my group of friends so that they were all to my left. Some girl who was part of her own group of friends sat to my right. This girl starts having those crying breathing spasms at the emotional sections of the movie, and it makes it even harder for me to stop tearing up. I'm also sweating buckets for all the fight scenes, because I'm emotionally filled with rage and the desire to bullrush some mechwarriors. The movie ends. The crying girl next to me, she and I both stay seated there while both of our respective friends immediately jump up to stand in line to file out of the theatre. She was really crying really loud during those quiet emotional scenes so she has to know that myself and everyone around her had heard.

I think we are not on the same page.

Keep in mind that most commonly used imperative languages nowadays *do* have garbage collection, and even imperative updates in those languages can keep the old value around to be garbage collected later rather than simply replacing it right then, especially when the language uses references a lot (again, most of your non-C-like languages). If your beef is with the garbage collection then it's not really immutable updates that you are having issues with.

True. To make it clearer, if all pics on NSFW Reddit were pics of boobies, one could say 'All pics on NSFW Reddit are pics of awesome boobies.' However, that would not mean 'All pics of awesome boobies can be found on NSFW Reddit.' newlinechar  newlinechar *I don't know if that makes things clearer or if it's even a valid example. I've just been on NSFW Reddit for too many hours I guess and wanted to say something awesome about it.*

Ok, but that's almost exactly my point. newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `const` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.1st}` newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `flip const` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.2nd}` newlinechar  newlinechar To understand the Haskell version, you have to think about what definition of the const function and what it would mean to exchange the arguments, because this isn't a natural thing to do with a function (IMHO). Whereas in Swym, first class functions always take one argument. So the Swym equivalent is just a function that takes a list, and returns the second element of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I know which _I_ find clearer, at least. newlinechar  newlinechar Or you want to keep the function call in there: newlinechar  newlinechar Haskell: `flip foo` newlinechar  newlinechar Swym: `{.2nd.foo(.1st)}` newlinechar  newlinechar Less terse this time, but IMO, still far less confusing.
Very well educated. It's too bad there aren't many opportunities for success locally, what with the 'go slow' and 'any time from now' attitudes and all.
Spivak is good but it doesn't follow the current 'standard' curriculum, so you can use it to gain a deeper understanding, but you won't be able to study for your class from it. newlinechar  newlinechar Stewart I &amp; II is not bad.  It's good for being precisely what it is: a chapter-by-chapter guide to the current curriculum.  If you want to pass your classes, all you need is Stewart's; but the questions are all rather easy and just variations on what you might get asked on a quiz or test, so it won't really drive you to think outside the box. newlinechar  newlinechar Stewart won't go into details or proofs, unless it's absolutely vital for being able to solve the questions.  It's all sort of 'here is what this means -- here is how you solve such a question with this method; here is how you solve this other kind of question -- Next chapter.' newlinechar  newlinechar Stewart has the 'problems plus' section (problems that are hard), but since the book itself doesn't read at this level, they're all just seem out of the blue, because the book never prepared you to deal with such problems in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar Stewart III (multivariable; vectors) is **horrible**.  I had to buy a different textbook because it was so bad.  It literally feels like a Schaum's study guide.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a book that's at a bit of a higher level than Stewart's, but more or less follows the same curriculum, check this one out: http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-I-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387909745/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1262305260&amp;sr=8-2 newlinechar  newlinechar Not to mention they're cheap ($30 - $40).

No, you can't. newlinechar  newlinechar People that respond without thinking say they are expensive or call it the 'Apple tax'.  If they were informed, they would know that Apple doesn't make a low end computer. When comparing, they compare a cheap value build against an Apple that is better built, better components and has better specs. newlinechar  newlinechar This is where the line blurs. I have experience with Mac,PC, *nix and I have built 3 computers last year. newlinechar  newlinechar I have an old laptops: iBook, Gateway, Dell and Sony. newlinechar  newlinechar The Gateway/Dell were really cheap ~$600. They are cheap because they use cheap components and have low grade specs.  The Sony is about equal on specs and quality, but costs the same as the iBook. newlinechar  newlinechar The iBook still has value, the others are worthless. The Gateway is junk, needing the most repair with HD and failure of the network card, among some of the repairs. The Dell and Gateway are twice the size and weight of the Sony and Apple. newlinechar  newlinechar *You can spend a perfect amount of money on a reasonably priced/cheap PC that addresses a low-end market segment that Apple doesn't address.*

My use of violence to solve a perceived problem defined me as a bully.

I tried both the Juniper PA and Yellow Snow IPA over the last few days.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Juniper was a mild pale ale, a distinctive hop finish (light but clear) and the juniper berries were noticed but only if you were expecting them. It is a crisp pale ale, and worth trying once but I wouldn't buy a six pack of it (more so for the price). newlinechar  newlinechar The Yellow Snow followed a Simcoe DIPA (definitely the wrong order but I was too excited for the Simcoe). It also came late in the night on New Years eve so I can't give a very thorough review but I distinctly recall a long bitter finish that erased all of the floral character of the hops without the pine-citrus lingering present in the Simcoe. newlinechar  newlinechar

No, they are coerced and brainwashed, and pushed over the edge when they see their family members and country-men being killed by foreign invaders.

The idea of *support groups* is that they are there to support you, however you might need it. Some people never contribute, others are frequent contributors. Often, the membership of support groups fluctuates over time, as new people enter and others leave, and as the members' needs change (e.g., you might go regularly one year, and only once or twice the next year). Usually the support group meets at a regular time, and is open to whoever shows up. A good way to find a support group in your area is to check with [NAMI](http://www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=Find_Support).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [If you were in *group therapy*, it's possible that it would be a different story.

Actually the oracle does speak in his favor. newlinechar It thinks you are spelling it wrong and wants you to 'See results for: 'double double' coffee'. newlinechar  newlinechar Also your math doesn't make any sense.  There are 150,00 people per In n Out.  Well then why isn't there more of them?  The demand for Tim Hortons is so high, we need 1 to serve for every 10,000 people.  If there is 240 In n Out locations in total, each location actually serves 1.3 million people each. newlinechar  newlinechar Not to mention people buy Double-Doubles every single day.  If people in the States bought a Double Double from In n Out everyday they would all get.... oh wait.

I join paysite for two reasons. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Is I like to download and amass stockpiles of porn without having to worry about going to look for the videos free on some website. I know you can do this for free, but on paysites I like the interface and I like to know exactly what I'm downloading, which leads me to 2. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Security. Back when I went the free route I had all kinds of problems with my computers. I'd try to be careful but malware seemed unavoidable. So every once in a while do some research on decent, cheap porn sites and I'll sign up to add to my porn pile.   newlinechar  newlinechar I still do use pornhub from time to time. newlinechar

The reasons people pay to go to the movie are the following (non-inclusive list): newlinechar  newlinechar * they don't know how to get it for free newlinechar * they don't want to break the law even though the odds of facing any punishment is nearly 0 newlinechar * they feel like they are 'stealing' (or whatever semantics you want to use) from the creators newlinechar  newlinechar So as we progress forward, the people who don't know how will go down.  If, as a society, we de-stigmatize piracy and essentially make it legal, the number of people who will pirate movies will skyrocket.  Without the sense that you are denying the creators profit that guilt will subside and you 'rational' market place theory will start to come to the fore. newlinechar  newlinechar At that point, it will be to late to change the attitudes back and there will be considerable damage done to the people who make these movies for a living. newlinechar  newlinechar So yes, currently the ballancing point still leaves the studios making profits, but if we buy into the idea of validating piracy, will we not eventually cause irreperable harm to the industry?

Whenever I see a sentence that begins with 'Canadians believe/care/don't believe/don't care ...' or words to that effect, I look for the statistics that back up the statement that follows. Generally, as in this case, those statistics are nowhere to be found. So what the writer actually means is '_I_ believe/care/don't believe/don't care'. Which in the case of something called 'The shotgun blog' in the 'Western Standard', doesn't really surprise me.

This is true, but when it comes down to actually convicting someone of anything, having nothing but the word of others is akin to witch trials in which someone squeals witch and points their fingers. I think the jury's incompetence had a lot to do with the conviction, but the biggest flaw is that this even went to trial. There was evidence that the defendant's character was questionable, but not any physical evidence that he had committed any crime.

There weren't any primitive wars between homo sapiens and 'homo capensis' primarily because the Boskop race was a constructed idea dependent on systematic misclassification of large skulls. Homo capensis ultimately is homo sapiens. newlinechar  newlinechar http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/brain/paleo/lynch-granger-big-brain-boskops-2008.html newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Ronald Singer (1958) reviewed the 'Boskop race' evidence as it existed by the 1950's. He concluded that there was no reason to maintain that any 'big-headed, small-faced group' had existed in prehistory, separate from the current biological variability of 'Bushman, Hottentot and Negro.' But that view is unsupportable -- in fact, what happened is that a small set of large crania were taken from a much larger sample of varied crania, and given the name, 'Boskopoid.' **This selection was initially done almost without any regard for archaeological or cultural associations -- any old, large skull was a 'Boskop'**. Later, when a more systematic inventory of archaeological associations was entered into evidence, it became clear that the 'Boskop race' was entirely a figment of anthropologists' imaginations. Instead, the MSA-to-LSA population of South Africa had a varied array of features, within the last 20,000 years trending toward those present in historic southern African peoples.

I'd like to note a possible error made in your report. Under the category listing Prasoc's infractions leading to his comment being downvoted you checked off that it was being downvoted for 'improper grammar, punctuation, and/or capitalization.' Now while it may be technically correct(although this is the best kind of correct) that while his comment did contain improper grammar, punctuation, and/or capitalization, I don't believe this is why he was being downvoted because his infraction in that area was extremely minor and worth forgiving. I'd also like to note that if any addendum is ever added to your report there may be special consideration warrented to add that his original comment was also being downvoted further because in his second comment he was sort of a prick. newlinechar

This is why I learned early on that smoking often would be a bad idea for me. Just like with alcohol, I slept a fairly rock-solid and dreamless night, but it was not restful in the slightest.

Even with more sleep, after smoking, I would still not feel rested and have that kind of depressed hangover feeling by later the next day.

One other thing I just wanted to add: newlinechar  newlinechar One of the interesting things about being a Christian is that it's not just something you think yourself into.  Being saved is a supernatural act, and requires more than just human intervention.  This leads us to an interesting paradox, because it means that I could never argue you into being a Christian.  If I could then it would mean that it was just the work of a man, and no more powerful than the work of a man.   newlinechar  newlinechar Being saved requires an encounter with God, and while that's difficult for me to explain to someone who hasn't experienced that, it's important because it's what differentiates Christians from cults like Scientology newlinechar  newlinechar

Why does anybody have the right to kill people?
There are reasons. She was no longer at her apartment, her car was never there again. I did not know the location of her original house where she lived with the abusive husband. I tried googling her, but nothing came up, nothing relevant anyways. I did call a number of times. She was also worried about being disowned from her family. She spoke of it several times. Her number 1 priority through everything was to avoid not being disowned. Thus her decision. newlinechar  newlinechar If she were to contact me, I'm confident that she would have had an opportunity at least once over the past year.

the sex offenders registry is iffy.. my husband and i are also against many parts of it. it has been horribly abused and used to continue to punish people long long after their crimes. Many people put on it do not deserve it. For example, there are middle and high school aged children who get put on it for sending naked pictures to each other ( a natural thing for teens to do).. then they both get charged as sex offenders. Some of it's downright ridiculous. However, pedophelia is not like many other crimes in the fact that is a psychological condition and they cannot help their attraction and a high % of them are destined to repeat their crimes and this poses a real and valid threat. I do think it should exist, but I think it should be restricted to rape and valid cases of child molestation. You may also be interested to know there's quite a large organization called NAMBLA which is made up of pedophiles who, like this guy from the group, believe that there should be no age of consent and that they should be able to sleep with whomever they wish regardless of age.

It's about being environmentally friendly. Our job as citizens of God is to reduce threats to the ecosystem, such as pollution, poaching, overproduction, overhunting, and overfishing, because they can and have caused extinction and other very big problems, including health problems. God doesn't want us to be unhealthy, thus he doesn't want pollution.  newlinechar  newlinechar Controlling population growth is an important aspect of survival. Right now, for example, it's too high, so God wants us to find ways to keep in check our out of control growth. It's not that we don't have enough space. It's that production of food, medical, and other essential resources can't currently keep up with demand, which will rapidly increase unless we as God's responsible creatures do something. Luckily, God has given us birth control in the form of contraceptives, abortion, and reversible vasectomies. Satan doesn't want us to use these miracles God has provided for us, so we have to spread the word that Genesis 1:28 has gracefully charged us with environmental responsibility.  newlinechar  newlinechar It also means that God also wants us to help narrow the stratification between rich and poor, to better care for the world He has provided for us and its inhabitants.

&gt;Well, you might as well see the bright side of things: this is NOT going to look good for your wife when you go to court.

If she's not a bad mom/isn't abusing her kid, why doesn't she deserve unsupervised visits? newlinechar  newlinechar I mean yeah, what she is doing is wrong, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't be involved with her kid without some social worker beating her down for being a shitty mom. Being held accountable in court/being fined seems like the most fair thing to do to her. If he can scare the shit out of her with possible kidnapping charges or something, I doubt she is going to do it again. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing/question for the OP; I assume you guys are on bad terms. Did she ask for extra time with her kid and you denied it, or is she just being a bitch? newlinechar  newlinechar The advice goes for *both* of you when I say this, but being parents is still a partnership even after a divorce.

Yeah, so just as clarification for everyone here, 'pinecone' or 'pine cone' is not the generic term for the cone of a conifer. It would be like calling every compact car a Civic, but calling some of them, for example, a Civic Corolla or a Civic Escort or something. It's the specific name for the cone of the pine tree, and since this here is not a pine tree, it does not produce pine cones. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Downmodded? Wow, reddit. Wow.

When going into combat situations, the Redemption could carry a limited number of starfighters attached to the docking tubes, and the ship could continue to move through space while another vessel was attached, pulling the smaller vessel along.

But should the say-so of those witnesses be the only evidence to convict someone of a charge such as murder? There is no other evidence that suggested a crime even took place. The witnesses did not even see the defendant in the company of the victim when she disappeared, there were even some witnesses that testified that they saw the victim driving out of town by herself in her car (which was never found, by the way). newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think that witness testimony alone is admissible enough to convict someone of that hypothetical robbery? Theoretically, I suppose you can convict anyone of anything with any amount or type of evidence as long as the jury says guilty, but if these types of things even go to trial, we have to question the government taking these types of loosely-built cases to court as a whole.

I can not tell you how offensive you are.  Serving your country is an honorable trade, something you can't seem to realize.  No, the troops aren't fighting for your freedom, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve our support.  I can not believe you would equate the military and police with abominations such as Blackwater and other PMCs.   newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe you should learn what patriotism is before you piss on it.  It is unwavering love for your country, not for what politicians do in the name of your country.  That's a difference you should learn before you attack someone for loving their country. newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree that the mixture of military and police into some paramilitary organization is extremely disturbing, and that the Department of Homeland Security has done little but make matters worse. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not the troops you should hate, it's the politicians manipulating the people that you should hate.

Chicofaraby, that's true for first-term and most second term abortions, but that is not necessarily true for all abortions.  Certainly, you would agree that in late-term abortions where the fetus has reached the age of viability, but for some reason the mother could not safely deliver, someone has died.  It's just that in that situation, the death is justifiable because society's interest in protecting the life of the mother is greater than society's interest in protecting a viable fetus. No? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I think forums like this are the best way to convey certain things to people without offending them personally. newlinechar  newlinechar My tip to Indians is to put their clothes in a closet and close the door when they cook. Get a good exhaust fan that vents out -- you are dead if you are in an apartment -- like I suffered. Your choice is to keep some clothes in your car and use them. This way, the clothes don't pick up the spice smell. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: More explanation, from below: newlinechar I wasn't clear in my earlier response. The odor issue has a lot to do with oily, spicy cooking than other things. Indian cooking is designed for Indian homes which are well ventilated and where the kitchen is separated from living quarters. Here, in the USA, recirculated air is the norm. This is a huge problem if you cook with oil and spices. The spice flavored oil evaporates and settles on everything including clothes, hair etc. Indians who live in apartments are especially vulnerable to this problem. Keep clothes in closets or in some other place where the recirculated air doesn't reach.

It's scary not being in control of a highly unsure/unstable situation, especially when regarding legal drama and your little one.

Aminaja -- What part of india do you come from? I am from West India (Gujarat). Most modern day arranged marriages are similar to the one i went through. My advise is make sure that you are not being forced to get married. In the meetings that i went through...I was trying to understand the 'nature' of the girl, likes and dislikes. I wanted to get marred to a person who was highly educated, understood cultural and religious values, etc. I just want you to know that the guy is as much scared as the girl on the whole marriage thing. I was really scared when i started. Ask for a couple of meetings before making your decision and ask all the questions...don't be conservative..its your life. Ensure that your family performs an extensive background check...how is the family situation (Socially and Financially), how are his friends, does he have any siblings, do they live in a joint family or not...etc. these are really important questions and determine how a person behaves, and acts.

I think the problems are mainly with the implementations. It's not easy to implement FRP efficiently. I have the impression that most implementations are either not efficient (for example they sample the time, and execute, say 50 times a second, which is bad both for efficiency and semantics), or buggy (Conal Elliott's reactive, which is very tricky, and because of that it is hard to understand what's actually happening, and that results in very subtle bugs; it also depends very heavily on the runtime system).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yampa is arrow based, which is not universally liked, and I think (but I'm not sure at all!) that it samples the time, too.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My current opinion is that a dataflow-based implementation (that is, we create an event graph, and simulate it; I think the elerea library works this way) would work pretty well, and would be relatively easy to reason about. Though if we allow to dynamically generate events, it becomes somewhat tricky. Now this would be an essentially imperative implementation, and some purists may be not satisfied with that :)

Let me ask you then...why was the President even asked if they would investigate or prosecute crimes of the past if he has no involvement in these affairs? I mean if the DOJ or the AG has nothing to do with him then they work free and clear of his involvement and his staff is what you are saying?  newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, I am going to try and be clear here, you know connect the dots. This trial stems from alleged war crimes by a company contracted to work for the Ferd gov in the capacity of peace keeping for a better term mercenary. Now, this all was done under the last administration, and these contracts and crimes stem from the previous administration. Now, this was not the only crime committed and acquitted under the war inception and execution by the previous administration, in fact many war crimes and treasonous acts have been documented that people in the previous cabinet have been culpable for. Although this case has no bearing on the previous statements of the President, the two are one in the same as they are both from the same time frame and people involved and incidents. This unfortunate ruling and failure of the DOJ to prosecute those who would revel in mayhem and death and are hired psychopaths is very unfortunate, the act of the President to openly admit he has no desire to even look at the people responsible or hold those to the rule of law is even more disheartening. I hope that makes it clear and I might connect the dots for you....but my guess is going to be....it wont for you.

Hmm, the bras I have are all different brands. I have a couple by Chantelle and Elixir, and one really nice one from Eprise although I can't remember much any other brand off the top of my head (some of the tags have come off).  newlinechar  newlinechar I would suggest, above all else, asking a sales associate about what brand would fit you best. For example, my breasts tend to be closer together and sit high, so I have to look for bras with sturdy straps that have a lot of adjustment and have a smaller gathering between the cups.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once they know how your breasts sit - if they're good! - they should know what brands tend to work for that type of fit. I would suggest that would be the best place to start. I've had luck with some $125 bras (which are lower quality, in my opinion) and less luck with some pricier ones at $300. So really, it's about finding a brand that works for you! But, all in all, the switch to good quality, for me, was such a good change :)

By AA standards yes, I am. I haven't been to a meeting in about a week, I'm getting tired of meetings and the people at my regular meetings. I'm taking a break from it for now, I've handled this for a good while now without a sponsor. Like I said I've been bitter around the holidays but I haven't picked up a drink. Yeah it sucks, and yeah I get pissed off about it which I shouldn't according to the program, but I see nothing wrong with that as long as I don't pick up a drink. It's human nature to be pissed every once in a while and going to a meeting just so people can tell me 'Don't be bitter' and 'Don't let it get to you' isn't what I want right now. Those same people that were once reliable and dependable haven't been lately. They don't call back or wont pick up the phone so why should I go out of my way to try to be the responsible one? You can only help those who help themselves, and in AA we're supposed to support each other.

Improved flow of data allows better decision making in the production lines resulting in lower overhead on production and warehousing of goods and more timely delivery to the consumers of those goods.

Yes, well as much as possible. The reoccurring vomiting cycle is sporadic and makes it difficult for them to do anything planned, but she in good hands and they make the best with what they can. She is only 2, but they are also limited by medical debt as well.

We were together for a little over four years (when I was 17-21). I was still going to school working at a supermarket at the time, and we were both very naive to the ways of the world. She grew up in a strict household with foreign parents who pressured her to get married all the time, because in her parents country it is common for girls to get married when they are younger than 18, so at the age of 21 she was seen as a 'failure' for not being married.

We fell in love at a young age, we were both 14. While we were 'together' for a while we only started actually going out a couple months before I left the county for three years.

Can you point it out?  
Religions do contradict each other, and often in fundamental ways that can be considered blasphemous by followers of other religions. It seems that if someone makes certain statements in favor of their religion, they may be (likely unknowingly) making 'blasphemous' statements about someone else's religion (possibly with no ill intentions towards the other religion(s). newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if the follower of a religion that promotes idol worship  (e.g. Buddhist, Hindu) praises that practice, a follower of another religion that considers idol worship blasphemous (Islam, Christianity) can be offended by it, even if the first praising their practice meant no ill-will towards the other religion. Another example, would it considered blasphemous to eat beef in front of a person who considers cows sacred and blasphemous to hurt cows? newlinechar  newlinechar Laws against blasphemy can't protect contradicting religions, and most religions by their nature have contradictory beliefs where what's considered sacred in one religion is blasphemous in another. Such laws can only work in a religious state with only one official religion, not in a secular state.

You almost sound like your attributing the troubles in Northern Ireland to religion. It's a common mistake, but the conflict never had anything to do with religion, it was to do with territory and civil rights. 
Why? Did you think it was too long/bad or inaccurate?
Introversion is preferring, on average, solitary activities to social activities or getting 'energized' by solitary activities and 'drained' by social activities whereas shyness is being scared of other people. At least that's the definition I'm using. There is of course a correlation between the two but one does not *have* to be one to be the other. newlinechar  newlinechar It is not conductive to intellectual relationships because its effects are not conductive to intellectual conversation. If we can't fairly quickly find an area of common interest for conversation then I'm not very interested in creating a relationship with that person. Let's just say that I don't involve myself in one of the other three examples you have given.
It's a related term, and it certainly applies to the fundamentalists (of all religions) who are reacting against modernity and trying to drag us back to a medieval society where government power is absolute and people's rights are limited, but I don't think it's totally a propos for everyone on the Right.   newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of what I see so-called 'conservatives' doing is just stirring the pot -- trying to find an issue that's on people's minds (like immigration, or healthcare) and staking out a position that is not reasoned at all, but rather designed to stoke emotion.   A 'reactionary' in the strictest change would try to stop change; these people just want to turn change into conflict, and turn that conflict into a book deal, or speaking engagements, or political donations that can get them votes.

Have you gone and looked up everyone else?  newlinechar  newlinechar I actually disagree with the other people who wanted to release him from the group. I would have talked with any youths that may have wanted to join the group about safety because they are going to need it in their own lives.  newlinechar  newlinechar Most places have a youth group that is separate from the regular group. However there are functions that co-mingle.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would have been a spotter or some sort of monitor instead of asking him to leave. I wouldn't have let him know that I knew.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I was part of a group when I was 17 we had a creepy guy who wanted SO BADLY to meet my younger brother. I kept my brother away from this space. If my brother had been gay I would have told my brother about safely joining and about never being in a room alone with ANYONE. I would have been his spotter.  newlinechar  newlinechar The NH Center opened and low and behold, same creepy guy was there. He was a productive member of the group though most people didn't like him. We tolerated him because he had no where else to go. The adults were VERY MINDFUL of where he was at all times. They were very mindful of WHO was around too.  newlinechar  newlinechar You outed him to the whole group.

You're talking about something like 'anticipation utility' where I can get happiness from, say a vacation, before it even starts because I can think about how great it'll be to leave my office on that day and head over to the plane, yes? newlinechar  newlinechar I actually don't know of any experiments or theories talking about this (though there is some theoretical paper about how expectations about the future are used in forming reference points, for example, I expect a 10% raise so getting a 5% raise instead feels like a loss of $500 or whatever).

I never said anybody owes me anything. Nobody owes me jack shit. We have all three of the mentioned, especially the community. I am extremely proud of the community we have developed.

Its not that much trouble to right click and view server info. I want a home in the game, and i greatly enjoy running the server. In order to keep it alive, i do what i have to do. I know it makes me 'the bad guy' in these situations, but our tiny little pub is rounding about 200 group members now and the community is absolutely amazing. You don't have to sympathize, but stop complaining. I'll bet you most of the good servers you play on that you think don't use the tool do in fact use the tool and you just don't realize it.
Why do we young people think our generation is so profound?

Maybe it's just because most of us are just now discovering how the world works and with the internet information, and subsequently anger, travel faster.   newlinechar  newlinechar At the same time though, the last intellectual debate I saw on TV was filmed in the late 80's with Frank Zappa.

I have to vehemently disagree. I have two best friends that insist that a word is defined by its common-use, and not by any objective measure. If we take this to be true, merely because most people are too godam lazy to know what they're saying, we are catering to their willful idiocy. Urban Dictionary is NOT a good indicator of meaning, at best it is one more way for people to use words based on their loose sense of said word's connotation. If you want to say something and have it mean *anything* you have to get over this semantic game of 'common-use' and start insisting that people bother to know what the flying-fuck they are saying.

This is actually backwards. It's fine to put a smaller tube in a bigger tire. Ever pumped up a tube outside of a tire? They get huge.

Putting a bigger tube in a smaller tire is riskier because of the increased chance of pinch flats.

They'll also be able to recommend products that suit your hair type which leads me to 2) Get the right type of Shampoo and Conditioner. You'll probably also want some leave-in conditioner or something similar so your hair doesn't go all frizzy.  I am currently in love with the line of [Be Curly products by Aveda](http://www.aveda.com/templates/products2/mpp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY14404) 3) Get a [hairdryer with a diffuser](http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/53000098/Images/1/CPD_1.jpg). Yes, this is heat but it won't damage your hair and it is less intense. You don't have to wait 1 hour+ for your hair to dry, it will increase the effectiveness of whatever leave-ins you're using and reduce frizz much better than air-drying can. When you get out of the shower you should blot (not rub) your hair, comb it out with a pick, add in all the serums, etc. and then dry it with a hairdryer using the diffuser.  After that **do not brush your hair**, it will only increase frizz and poufiness.  newlinechar  newlinechar Straightening I don't know too much about but I'm fairly certain it will require blowdrying and using a flat-iron (i.e. heat). This is something to ask the stylist at the salon about maybe.
I think the last panel is the more-better.
Really? Oh man, I just realized that the recipe I'm using calls for salt, but does not actually mention it in the steps. I already mixed and set the bread for rising. How should I add in salt at this point? Eeek!

Well, it sounds like it requires installation of software, which Tiddlywiki doesn't.  Tiddly wiki is platform agnostic, since you just need a browser that supports java.  Put it on a thumbdrive and you can take it with you anywhere and use it on any pc/mac/linux box with a standard browser and java.  It's also supported with a wide array of plugins that do all sort of things (admittedly, almost none of which I've found any need to use, so I can't really argue for their usefulness), and has an option to autosave to a new file with a date/time stamp (so it's not overwriting) after any change, which makes it far less likely that you'll lose a day's worth of work.  I don't really know how many, if any, of those features Kabikaboo has going for it - I saw a lot about branching nodes, but that's pretty easy to accomplish in TiddlyWiki since it's basically a pocket-sized wiki. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.tiddlywiki.com/

For the record, I hear what you're saying and I think it's quite interesting.  The core of your issue with these gov't programs is the involuntary nature of the transaction.  You have no problem giving to the needy but you want to choose who you give to, and not the government choosing.  If this accurately characterizes your perspective then I actually agree with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Where I think we may disagree is how to address this problem.  I think that the idea of institutionalizing 'giving to the needy' is important, because if not institutionalized I think that many will suffer from the greed of those who may choose to not give (or to take).  The institutionalization could take the form of an estate, where you might specify the various categories of those who can benefit from your tax dollars (i.e., sick children of poor families; those who have a preexisting condition and have been denied insurance 3 or more times; etc...)

I agree that a movie about such a scenario will be loaded with plot holes, but I simply don't agree with yours. They stockpiled the cigarettes. They were using the oil left in the oil tanker (revealed as the Exxon Valdez at the end). They stockpiled jetskis and retrieved parts from leftover ones (think Cuba and their 50's cars). The water came from the melted ice caps (as stated at the beginning of the movie)(though recent studies have shown that water levels would in fact rise by a couple of hundred feet, thus not immersing all of the landmass). The salty dirt I'm not too sure about, but likely due to the importance of said dirt, they would find a way to de-salt it. They ate plants that they grew and fish/seafood that they caught. The plant matter would biodegrade into dirt. The pool of filth that Costner almost drowned in would be the recycled dirt/feces you speak of. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, I liked the movie regardless of its fallacies.

Well, I do admit, it is an aquirred taste. When I got into metal, I initially only liked stuff with clean vocals, like classic Heavy Metal, Power Metal and Thrash. As I delved deeper into the underground, I encounter black metal, death metal, and grindcore. I thought to myself, what is this crap? How can one enjoy music with vocals like these. However, as I listened more, something changed, albeit very gradually. At first, I was just able to 'bear' it and be able to listen to the instrumentals, then I actually started to enjoy some of the more raspy, higher pitched vocals, and then finally, I was enjoying the most brutal of death metal. I guess it is much like alcohol in a sense. You don't start of with whiskey, you start of with beer. Even then, some people won't like it no matter how much they listen to it. To answer your question about what I like about it, I guess the simplest answer is that it fits the rest of the music. I mean, you wouldn't Cher fronting Mayhem, it just wouldn't sound right. newlinechar  newlinechar I have to say, I am very glad you asked about this.

Interesting. newlinechar  newlinechar For me as a student, I am usually on a budget and fresh juice although better is much more expensive than store bought juice.  A lot of the juice is not really processed in the way you might think it is.  It is pasteurized and filtered.  Sometimes they will add some vitamins to it; but the organic juice is rarely more than just filtering and pasteurization. newlinechar  newlinechar One big difference though is that cider from mills is that it is a mix of different apples.  These will generally ferment better in terms of flavour whereas store bought juice is usually one type of apple from what I understand.  But paying an extra 3-5 bucks a gallon gets expensive whe you are buying a lot.

Actually it is a good metaphor. The 787 may or may not be a good plane but it is entering a market that is already saturated with good quality Airbus planes. Ironically Airbus decided to enter the market of Boeing at the same time. Seems a bit wasteful to me. Airbus had a good market on short/medium haul and Boeing in long haul. By entering each others markets the increased competition is simply going to undermine the profit of both.

Another, related trick.  Sometimes I see an if-else ladder: newlinechar  newlinechar     if(x) newlinechar         a(); newlinechar     else if(y) newlinechar         b(); newlinechar     else if(z) newlinechar         c(); newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is, semantically, each of the nested if's should be indented: newlinechar  newlinechar     if(x) newlinechar         a(); newlinechar     else newlinechar         if(y) newlinechar             b(); newlinechar         else newlinechar             if(z) newlinechar                 c(); newlinechar  newlinechar This is why people put `else if` on the same line: the indentation would get out of hand quickly.  Python solves this using `elif`, which is a much cleaner solution.  So I sometimes add `elif` to C with this macro: newlinechar  newlinechar     #define elif(cond) else if(cond) newlinechar  newlinechar Now you can do this: newlinechar  newlinechar     if(x) newlinechar         a(); newlinechar     elif(y) newlinechar         b(); newlinechar     elif(z) newlinechar         c(); newlinechar  newlinechar There is a readability concern here, but I've asked people reading my code if they found it problematic, and nobody has so far.  A lot of C programmers are familiar with other languages that include `elif`, I guess. newlinechar  newlinechar One last note.  The macro could also be this: newlinechar  newlinechar     #define elif else if newlinechar  newlinechar ...but in some weird cases, like forgetting the condition, that would drive people to have to look at the macro to figure out what the error is.  It probably makes no difference, but I still use the macro `#define elif(cond) else if(cond)`

I have seen the industry work on issues and can say that it moves with the speed of frozen molasses on issues that could impact the bottom line even where public safety is concerned. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The first spill that I worked on involved cleaning spilled oil from a small creek that drained into a river and thence to a lake which supplied the drinking water for several communities. The spill was originally blamed on a rusty, aging pipeline once owned by Exxon but sold to a smaller independent (SOCO) in the 60's I think. The pipeline leaked regularly so we had lots of work keeping it in shape and cleaning spills. However, over the course of two years of revisiting this creek to clean oil thought to have leaked from the pipeline, it became increasingly obvious that the true source was not the pipeline but was from something near the pipeline just up the hill from the creek. The pipeline itself paralleled the creek at the leak site. After much research we ended up digging a trench up the hill from the pipeline and we managed to find an old, unplugged well that had been noted on drilling records from the boom days (20's and 30's here).

Well, with the Y2K, simple patches were able to fix any possible problems. The only 'major' issues would arise in banking and applications that rely on the year. A lot of that was overhyped since a lot of stuff wouldn't be affected at all, and the few things that were affected could just be patched. newlinechar  newlinechar IPv4 Exhaustion is another problem. There is no 'patch' or something to solve it. There is a hard limit in how many addresses are available. Once that limit is hit, they can't just add more addresses. IPv4 has a major flaw in not being able to determine which addresses are no longer in use, so we also can't easily go back and just re-allocate those addresses.  newlinechar  newlinechar So I don't really see much of a similarity. Y2K could be fixed by a patch. IPv4 cannot have more than 4294967296 addresses, most of which have been used.
&gt; [Habeas corpus] simply gives people accused of crimes the right to know the charges against them and to know who's making the charges. newlinechar  newlinechar Actual definition: [any of several common-law writs issued to bring a party before a court or judge](http://m-w.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus). newlinechar  newlinechar I think you are confusing the right to face your accuser with habeas corpus.

Thanks for your explanation. I definitely do not agree though. I think when you are in a serious/close relationship there is nothing that can solely belong to only one individual, except thoughts. As soon as thoughts turn in to any type of practice they to some become a legitimate matter of concern for the other person as well. And I don't find that dehumanizing. To the contrary I take great pleasure in being able to share everything with someone.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to understand your perspective but I'm not there yet. So I have a couple of questions if you feel motivated to answer. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. If masturbation and sexual fantasy belong solely to the individual are there any limits for what one can do without informing/asking ones partners permission? Would it be ok to have sex with another person? Would it be ok to have sex with an animal? Would it be ok to engage in something illegal? Would it be ok to watch porn in which this type of stuff was going on? If not, why? I mean I could claim all of those are me acting out sexual fantasy and none of my partners business. And I could claim someone trying to stop me would be asking me to serve their pleasure. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Does this exclusive right to do as I please without someone being allowed to question me apply to anything but sexual fantasy and masturbation?  newlinechar  newlinechar Please note, I am not trying to be an ass here, I am honestly just trying to understand.

I do understand where you're coming from, because it's ridiculously annoying to hear people misuse academic terms all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I think it matters in terms of context and communication. The purpose of words, and language in general, is to efficiently communicate concepts.  The fact is, if 90% people use a word a certain way, the most efficient way to communicate with them will to use to the colloquial definition rather than the 'dictionary' definition.  It would just be a waste of time to use it 'correctly' and provide a subtext or extra explanation every time I use the word when I'm in conversation with people. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, context matters too.  If I'm writing an academic paper I'm going to use the correct terms, and perhaps clarify to the reader of which definition I am referring to.  Even if I'm having an 'intellectual' discussion, I might still do the same thing.  The problem is that words such as 'conservatism' are socially defined. Regardless of whatever's in the dictionary, or urban dictionary, the people that are being referred to when you say the word 'conservatives' are the people that call themselves 'conservatives.'  In the context of most political discussions, this is what matters, because this is the concept that is being communicated in this situation. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is, even the official dictionary people have come to terms with this. The OED will add colloquialisms if they have become prevalent in society.  I'm sure half of the words that I use in conversation started out as colloquialisms and were eventually just added to the dictionary.  I might hate it, and you might hate it, but the fact is, if I'm trying to communicate with someone, theres an easy way and theres a difficult way...

No doubt, but I'm just worn out with link after link after link.. I like that Reddit has a character of its own, but once things start getting so repetitive that every other post is 'Narwhals!

&gt; Suppose the logic loop updates the position of an object, but not another... do you just draw the scene with the objects temporally in the wrong place? newlinechar  newlinechar You can double buffer object position the same way graphics are double buffered.

Once all next positions are calculated, you flip them and make the next position the new current position.

Many problems with your post.  Taking them in order: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;By that definition, American liberals are all about tearing down traditional rights and institutions, or, in other words, liberals are anti-American. newlinechar  newlinechar You're incorrectly assuming that liberalism and conservatism are, in some dialectical sense, opposites, and that changing the meaning of one changes the meaning of the other.  In fact, classical conservatism is very closely related to what John Locke meant by 'liberalism' when he introduced the term.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fundamental conservative lie is that any effort to change the status quo to make the country better is an attack on 'traditional values.' newlinechar  newlinechar Anyone who takes this view, in my opinion, should not be referred to as 'conservative,' because that's not what conservatism really is.  See my original post. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;this inherent dishonesty, and the cynicism behind it, leads inevitably to Sarah Palin, FOX News, Teabaggers, Joe the Plumber, and all the authoritarian excesses... newlinechar  newlinechar Not true.  It may not be your philosophy, but skepticism about dismantling existing structures and ideals is not an inherently flawed way of looking at the word.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Only through dishonesty can conservatism, which aims to benefit very few at the expense of very, very many, establish itself as a popular movement with widespread support. newlinechar  newlinechar You're making an unwarranted leap here.  While the wealth gap has exploded over the past twenty years, benefiting the few at the expense of the many is not conservatism's goal.  Rather, part of the conservative worldview is that inequality is inevitable because distribution of resources and endowments is inevitable, but inequality is also an engine, especially if individuals have the freedom to try to advance themselves.  (I'm not endorsing this view, but I don't wholly disagree with it, either.) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  No, the conservative movement can't disown itself because it's finally coming off the rails. Sarah Palin's mindless, cynical, narcissistic ambition is the purest form of conservatism you'll ever see. newlinechar  newlinechar You've completely missed the point.  There is a philosophical core to conservatism (although chesterriley makes a [good argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/aklvl/stop_calling_them_conservatives/c0i2d1k) that it's a little more complicated than that).  Sarah Palin has no philosophical core -- she's just gyrating to get noticed, make money, and remain part of the discourse. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  Fixed formatting problems, which required rewriting a little bit, too.

To briefly expand on his point, the precision of a mouse is vastly greater than the precision of a pair of thumbsticks. That makes it a lot more fun to play on the PC; you quite literally can't have a competitive FPS on the console without an autoaim sytem. On the PC, autoaim is superfluous. newlinechar  newlinechar A few other points, in addition: a high end PC is graphically superior, with the availability of much higher resolution than a TV can provide, as well as higher res textures and MUCH more antialiasing and anisotropic filtering (AA removes jaggies, AI makes textures look better at an angle). newlinechar  newlinechar Mods are great, digital download is more mature, and indie games are easier and cheaper. You can use a joystick if you want, or all kinds of wonky controls, or an xbox controller. Doesn't matter. You can hook it up to your TV, if you want. newlinechar  newlinechar There are two tradeoffs for this stuff, that make it an argument rather than a blowout in favor of the PC: price and simplicity. A high-end gaming PC customized the way you want it is complicated and expensive. You will have more bugs, and you will have to manage settings for your games. That said, the RTS genre is only playable on the PC (console RTS games like Brutal Legend and Halo Wars are an entirely different experience than Company of Heroes or Starcraft). FPS games are more fun, and you can get bigger games (64 person matches? Fuck yes!). newlinechar  newlinechar So that's why I prefer the PC. I have an xbox, but it gets a lot less play.

You *have* to think about what the definition of the `const` (or any other) function is, because you want specify the behaviour of a program, and the computer cannot figure out, out of thin air, what you mean by '2nd' etc if you don't tell it *exactly* what you mean. So what you think is 'hideous' and 'unnatural' is in fact *necessary*. (Of course, in the case of `const` and other simple / standard functions, you don't really have to think, because the definitions are already internalized.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar btw, I don't find `{.2nd}` any clearer than `flip const` (actually it's the opposite). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Whereas in Swym, first class functions always take one argument: the Swym equivalent is just a function that returns its second argument. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, but I cannot make any sense out of this sentence (or its parts). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, `const` is just a function that returns its first argument. We gave it a name, because it is used often enough.

The new file formats were made to be more secure, and microsoft has released the compatibility pack for them to make it backwards compatible.  Most small companies have an IT guy come in once a month at least and if the small company doesn't then they can probably update it themselves.  For me, the ribbon has increased my productivity tremendously.  It is really a matter of opinion on whether or not the ribbon is bad or not.

And if businesses want to have a full featured version that is equivalent to the client based one then they can pay a subscription fee.  Starting in summer, crappy Microsoft works is going away too and Office 2010 starter will take its place with a basic, word and excel.  Like Open Office, it will be have the ability to run from a USB flash drive as well.

On the green light, I shove for all I'm worth, and the thing goes out the door, and I can see the eyes of the #1 jumper get big as shit.  AF loadmaster sticks his head out the door, and the bundle is spinning, being drug along at 120 mph, bashing into the plane.  AF cuts the bundle loose, closes the door, and we fly home.  No jump for us.  We get back to the AF base, and they won't let anyone off the plane.  We finally get out, and I check the plane.  That thing beat the *shit* out this plane, adn all we could do was laugh about it.  No shit, next jump, I'm pushing another one of these fuckers out the door.  This one goes out no problem, but I find out after the fact that when the chute opened, the bottom of the bundle opened and the entire system burns in.  The guy responsible for rigging was promptly relieved of his duties. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll try and think of more later tonight - I'm getting ready to go home from work, and wil promptly pass out upon reaching there.

That seems very different from what I'm wondering about.  If you get happiness from anticipating something, it's easy to understand why you'd plan such a thing even if it's not about to happen right now: you're increasing both your future happiness *and* your happiness right now.  That's pretty simple to understand. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm talking about decisions you make that *decrease* your current happiness (or, equivalently, deny you an increase you know you could have if you didn't make that decision) in favor of increasing your potential future happiness. newlinechar  newlinechar You'd like to eat that cake but you think you'll feel better later on if you don't; you'd like to spend money on something fun now but you think you'll be happier later if you save it, even though you don't have specific plans for what to spend it on later; you'd have a great time hooking up with him/her tonight, but you expect it'll cause you heartache later on; etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes people even go so far as to set up mechanisms to prevent themselves from doing what they know they'll choose to do later, because they don't trust the decisions they'll make then - so they put the cookie jar in a deep dark corner to shift the tradeoff they'll make later on when they're tempted to eat a cookie but not tempted strongly enough to go find the cookie jar, or they'll delete someone's number from their phone to guard against the time they may decide to call.

I think the same can be said for psychopathic people in general.  All of those centuries, the sexual abuse of kids by priests has been covered up, hushed under a rug because of religion.

If you haven't dumped it yet, it may still be good.  It will be preserved just fine in the bottles (think of it as a mini-secondary) and you could crack them all open, combine in keg, and force carb.  You may not have the equipment yet, but it could save your batch and be a smart investment.  Personally, I like bottles better, but I had so many problems early-on with carbing properly... I wish I had just started kegging earlier.

I bought a 1947 Nagant m44 that looked like it had never been fired or even taken out of the box. Now My thinking was that maybe the stock had been replaced. I am no expert on older firearms but this was a beauty. I payed 120 bucks for it. The only problem I have had is this: When firing after about 20 or so rounds, the bolt starts to jam. I'm pretty sure it's the ammo. (lacquered steel polish yellow tip made in 1955) other than the jams, the ammo is perfect (Never misfires) anybody have this same problem with an m44 or this polish ammo?

You would rather that search rely on someone commenting relevant words in the thread?  And how does it know that 'michael jackson' posted in the thread means the link is about michael jackson and that the poster wasn't just dropping a michael jackson joke? newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think you comprehend how search works.  Right now the search just searches words in the title.  So when people use clever funny titles that don't use specific words that the link would be described as, that can never be found again. newlinechar  newlinechar The only way to fix that is to let people tag stuff with keywords.  This is what many sites use.  Because it is the only way to do it.  Why try to parse out what you the link points to(would not work on pictures) or why try to search every word in every post in a thread?  Let the user put in keywords when they make the link. That way the post can be easily found and you don't have to reinvent google. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;if google already does a better job at searching than reddit then the search box on reddit should be replaced by the google custom site search feature. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no point in having a reddit search that does what google does.  Because anyone can use google now.  So if that is what you want, you clearly don't have a gripe.  Put 'site:reddit.com' at the end of your google searches and you are done.  Congrats you are now happy. newlinechar  newlinechar But people don't want to search a word and get every place in comments where that word was said.  They search something and they want links that apply to that word. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition they need to let people freely select a time frame. Many times people remember this happened last november, but you can't search last november.  You can only search for the last year.  That time frame is way too big.  People shouldn't have to include all of the most recent stuff in their searches.  They should be able to select and start and end date/time when searching. newlinechar  newlinechar If reddit is going to do comment searching, taht sh

Hyperbole.  A philosophy cannot be responsible for anything.  Responsibility rests with the people that use/abuse it.
I would recommend that you start with not letting her cum. Bring her right to the edge and then stop. preferably while restraining her.  It shouldn't take long until she is begging for it. Don't give it to her. Call her your toy, or pet. Tell her that she is yours and you can do what you want. 'Who's tits are these?', 'who's clit is this' until she says they are yours.  newlinechar Reward and punishment are always good. When something is not perfectly to your liking (perhaps when she is giving head), stop and correct preferably with pinches and strkes to the ass, thigh and back if she has a sensitive back.  Keep in mind once the skin has reddened it is much more sensitive, soft strokes, nails and occasional pinches will get a dramatic reaction.  newlinechar just controlling her head can add an edge to sex. a firm grip in the back of her neck, or on her Jaw, making her or preventing her from kissing you.  A possessive comment whispered in her ear.   newlinechar Take time, a lot of time, use it to make he feel as if you can make her feel anything you want, and if you study her reactions you can.  newlinechar Training is also a lot of fun. Think pet, reward is sexual stimulation and punishment is lack of stimulation or pain.  But as always you are in charge and sometimes you have to punish just because you enjoy it.  newlinechar Don't be afraid of telling her how much you like it. Tell her how pretty she is when you punish her too. Make it graphic. She makes you do it. It is her fault you know.  newlinechar   newlinechar

This is exactly the reason I've stopped speaking out against homoeopathic medicine as actively as I used to, although I did still speak out against it when someone I know was giving up treatment for a life threatening condition in favour of homoeopathic medicine.

Your second point is valid.  What separates healthy skepticism from denial, however, is skeptics base their disbelief on evidence.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Climate deniers, for the most part, do not cite evidence, they do not understand the evidence they cite, or they base their conclusions on facts that are irrelevant.  For example, evolution deniers frequently argue that since Darwin was an atheist the mountains of data that support the theory of evolution are irrelevant.  This is not skepticism but denial.

good point, I think you would be an idiot to listen to any other nation on a subject as important as this, though i suspect the solutions are based closely on each others work.   I suppose jack might have been working on some shonky first/second gen warhead from a developing nation in which case it's possible that a chemical timer would be used, still i don't think anything with the force to detonate the charge would go off randomly, the intense heat and vibration any icbm or plane delivered ordinance would undergo during deployment would set off a volatile reaction so one of the most basic fundamentals of design would have to be a stable charge which can be detonated only under the correct conditions - plenty of electronically stimulated substances exist for this purpose... I think that jack could pretty much rip into that thing however he pleases.
1.  Agreed, but if the landfills are holding carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, then they are a good thing.  The fact that they take thousands of years to decompose is exactly why they are such a good storage medium for carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. newlinechar 2.  If buried in a landfill, none of it ends up in the ocean. newlinechar 3.  UV degeneration should not happen without exposure to UV, which cannot happen in a landfill where the trash is not exposed to UV.  But this is a good point.  It still doesn't have any effect on the carbon equation of the bottle.

* Loved the new combat system. newlinechar * Went for Miranda.  No question I would after I finished Freedom's Progress with her.  Classy, sexy, intelligent and talented. newlinechar * Suicide mission was anti-climactic.  Would've wanted some more variation.  Example:  Protect a fire team from an elevated position while they get to an objective, arming time required for the nuke, disarming booby traps, etc.  For such a hyped up event, it was pitifully simple and easy.  Send a tech guy, fight through door, protect biotic, kill boss.  Done. newlinechar * Main questline was incredibly short, which was the same problem with ME1.  Why were the protheans turned into Collectors?  How did the derelict Reaper get there?  Why not add some more exploration and quests to the main story?  Essentially it boiled down to this: Tutorial, Collector Ship, IFF, Collector Base.  That was it.  That was the entire main story. newlinechar * Side missions were a huge step forward, and getting rid of the Mako was just heavenly.  They need some more scripted events, voice acting and important side mission quests and the next game will be perfect. newlinechar  newlinechar And this other thing is a small, but still very annoying gripe. newlinechar  newlinechar The character I ported over from ME1 was a Colonist/Sole Survivor.  He knew that the reason why his entire marine platoon died on Akuze was because Cerberus orchestrated the thresher maw attacks.  He calls out Cerberus for experimenting with husks, Thorian creepers and rachni, but doesn't say a peep about Akuze.  You would think a guy finding out that the organization that killed all of his best friends were the same ones that ressurected him would have a lot to say...  The most confusing part is when Jacob asked me about the event point blank on the shuttle to meet the Illusive Man, and Cerberus' involvement never came up.  And it failed to come up a second time when I received an e-mail from Corporal Toombs. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, some ship upgrades have a direct impact on gameplay, like being able to hold more fuel, house more probes and scan planets faster.  Everything else is to help your team survive the mission.  If your whole team is loyal, your ship fully upgraded and your team assignments sound, the whole crew will survive.

&gt;People relying on news and politicians for information is unavoidable. There should be laws against deliberate misinformation, is what I'm saying. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you 100%.

They should be held to some sort of standard when it comes to what they say since Fox is the most watched news network (or any news source for that matter) . I have a friend who believes everything on Fox is fair and balanced and will argue over any point until he is blue in the face, it is one of the most frustrating things I care to be around.

I consider myself a 'leftist', yet I never felt like my ideals were to go after successful people. If anything I felt my ideas (on regulation) would instead prevent a minority of people from exploiting the majority.  newlinechar  newlinechar However it's a little tricky when it comes to taxes... Idealistically everyone would contribute the same percentage (flat tax), however that is not likely going to be the case and you will end up with some people unable to support the system. In order to prevent someone who is attempting to contribute from being dropped for financial concerns you would have to tax those who have an excess a little more.  newlinechar  newlinechar I choose a little unfairness in the taxes over people loosing access to social programs. This could be used as an argument for disbanding any kind of social programs, but I feel that this would be even more immoral - especially if it directly impacts the lives of thousands of struggling people (such as the loss of food stamps or in countries that have it - universal healthcare).

I understand your post.  I disagree.  As I said before.  We live in a very complex society where minarchist libertarian ideals have quetstionable practical value.  They have theoretical value, in much the same way me imagining that I can fly through the air in my dreams makes me feel better.  But when I wake up in the real world, I find I can't fly.   newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise, this notion of a minimal government that does nothing but provide national defense and run a court system, has no working example anywhere in the history of humanity.  I'm not sure how you figure such a system would ever get established.  It sure won't happen by electing Ron Paul.  Do you think you can get a bunch of libertarians elected into Congress and then they'll suddenly vote to disband the government?  I'm trying to figure out at what point your ideas are anything more than a fantasy that you have chosen to share with others in forums like this, and where they have any practical means of being implemented in modern society?  Do you think for a moment that if the government stopped regulating transportation, utilities, commerce and other areas that things would be better off?  I think you really underestimate the day-to-day benefits you gain from government support in modern day life, and how much more chaotic and unreliable things would be if private industry were less regulated. newlinechar  newlinechar And as I keep saying over and over, I can point to examples of areas where less regulation = more exploitation.  It's never the other way around, never.   So don't accuse me of not understanding what you mean. I understand what you mean.  I'm just saying, it appears to be an idea that isn't practical, and rather than give me exact details of how it could be practical, all you can do is talk in vague generalities or refer me to someone else who talks in vague generalities.   newlinechar  newlinechar Many years ago, I had a phone call with Harry Browne.  We talked for about two hours and I felt the same way... I liked the guys ideas but I was concerned about whether or not the libertarians actually had a *plan*.  I know they have *theories* but how to realistically put those theories into practice is another matter entirely.   That's when I found out Browne had no clue either. newlinechar  newlinechar I urge everybody to think for themselves.  Don't take my word for it.  Go look over every post in this thread.  Where is the **plan?**  There's no plan.  It's all a bunch of pompous ideas, and when someone inquires, they get sent off on a wild goose chase reading various published philosophies by other like-minded people.  Meanwhile, we live in the real world.  Not one of these guys will explain, realistically, how something like the Internet could ever exist in their minarchist society.  They talk theoretically of how things might seem 'fair' if they had their way, but they insist they can only prove it if they get 100% of what they want.  If they get 99% of their terms and things fail horribly, they'll still claim their ideas are workable and the reason is because of the missing 1%.   Over and over, it's the same thing.   Corporations fuck people up the ass each day, every day, but no.... if the market was totally open, suddenly that would change.   It sure seems like blind ideological thinking to me. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; Several of the posters to that thread make it clear that they rate a tax cut for themselves as more important than the torture and oppression of others. newlinechar  newlinechar I've read through that thread; but I'd really like it if you could point me to some of those posts. Thanks. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I would genuinely like to call myself a libertarian, but this obsession with taxation at the expense of other more serious threats to liberty is what prevents me doing so. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, then you just have a difference of opinion over what is a bigger threat to liberty. The idea is that taxes are one of the largest sources of government revenue, and therefore, if you cut that down (or off completely), then the government is forced to shrink in size. Therefore, other threats that the government causes are also reduced. newlinechar  newlinechar (However, I would tend to believe that abolishing the Fed is a stronger budget constraint than lowering taxes.) newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, I'm curious why you say, '... obsession with taxation at the **expense** of other more serious threats ...' I'm not sure what you mean.

They are anti choice *because* they believe that abortion is 'killing a baby', but that doesn't mean that the term 'pro life' is appropriate. Saying somebody is 'anti choice' isn't rude..it's a fact.

Either both invasions are justified or neither are.

I could be wrong, but posts don't really hit 1000+ unless they're in subreddits everyone subscribes to anyway.  If someone is unsubscribed from a subreddit like AMA or Funny, it's not because they're not aware of it, but because they don't want to see AMA posts.  I just feel like this might not be the most useful feature.
I don't know how you could disagree with my definition. It's pretty standard. There are different degrees of liberty and enslavement. For example, a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 3 hours a day is more of a slave and has less liberty that a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 6 hours a day.

If Americans gave up soda, for which they spend [66 billion dollars a year](http://www.casapalmera.com/blog/our-addiction-to-soda-what-we-can-do-to-stop/) and, instead, donated that money to food for the hungry in other parts of the world, that would improve the lot of the hungry far more, since NASA's nominal budget for 2009 was 17.2 billion dollars. But that's not going to happen. And, if NASA's budget was eliminated entirely, do you reallly think that's where the money would go? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) programs, as well as other program, are benefitting people on earth. I've excerpted a few paragraphs from [NASA Earth Science Data and Services: Distant fields of grain](http://nasadaacs.eos.nasa.gov/articles/2009/2009_crops.html): newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; From his Santa Barbara office, geographer Chris Funk is trying to watch ears of maize in Zimbabwe fill with kernels. Funk knows that years of drought and turmoil in Zimbabwe make it urgent to know exactly how well crops are growing there. As of February 2009, an estimated seven million people in Zimbabwe faced serious food shortages, many surviving on just one meal per day. Zimbabwe’s once-thriving agricultural production had fallen by more than half, and both political upheaval and drought contributed to the prospects of widespread hunger. The unraveling of the agricultural system also made it difficult to get good estimates of crop production. Funk said, “Governmental numbers don’t really exist. As a result, there were different ideas about the level of crop production in Zimbabwe.” newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; &lt;text snipped&gt; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Funk and Budde are studying Zimbabwean food issues as part of an interagency effort on world food security. Funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the project includes several partners, including NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), with which both Funk, at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Budde, at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, are affiliated. Not so long ago, outsiders became aware of a nation’s food crisis only when it had reached a dire stage: images of starving children flooded the news, as well as images of aid workers struggling to send relief in time. Satellites are among the technologies that now help people determine ways to intervene earlier, and in a more targeted manner. More than ten years ago, Funk worked on his first project to study crop production in southern Africa, using satellite data. Funk said, “I got hooked on the idea of using satellite information to help people in the developing world.” newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Funk and other researchers are using data captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/)), which is an instrument on NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft, and distributed through the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).

I liked the way you irrupted/disrupted the grammatical other into the (re)reader's (re)flected 'self'-consciousness via the jarring (re)present-ation of the superficially inappropriate existential 'it's' for the conventionally anticipated possessive 'its'. For is its 'it's', its *it is*, if not its 'its' of other possessing other? What, to the other is its being if it's unpossessed? It's its 'it's', its *being* other, its *it is* that it is/has in its 'its'. Being is possession; possession being, and in the otherness of possession is also its unbeing, its (it's?) *other-than-being*.
It's very much the more natural way for that rhythm to be played. It'd be much harder to try to alt-pick it, and it'd sound weird.

A lot of the cost is that it is highly specialized training, so you need to pay for teachers who could make a lot of money actually practicing in their field rather than teaching. Also the materials for learning are not cheap at all. There is some very expensive equipment people need to be trained on, corpses to dissect are not cheap, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Another factor, IMO, is to keep idealism to a minimum. No matter how idealistic you were when you started, by the time you can actually practice on your own, you have a quarter million in debt to worry about, so you can't just go off to a third world country and work for free, or help out poor people, or whatever you initially wanted to do. I see the same factor in a few other fields, notably law.

Interesting. I used to think that jsoverson's answer was correct and in fact, I remember doing the math for the ice skater example in my thermodynamics class and it working out all right.

Good explanation, and it only leaves out the inflationary effect.  To explain that, you have to talk about who benefits from the minimum wage. newlinechar  newlinechar Unions have negotiated for contracts which will automatically increase pay rates based on minimum wage.  People may be making 10%, 100% or 500% over minimum wage. newlinechar  newlinechar So, when the minimum wages goes up, a lot of people's pay rates go up proportionately, causing employers to raise prices.  Competitive forces will cause general prices to rise. newlinechar  newlinechar Then the question arises who is hurt by inflation?  People living on fixed incomes.

That is more than acceptable for Naxx. You'd be around Ulduar quality as well since raid buffed is more significant than heroic 5 man buffed. newlinechar  newlinechar 25 man has larger DPS requirements compared to 10 man, and rarely some slightly different boss tactics depending on boss (e.g. Instructor Razuvious 10 and 25 man in Naxxramas.) The DPS requirements per player are higher to make up slightly for both superior gear in 25 mans and the larger access to raid buffing. newlinechar  newlinechar A good place to find boss tactics, which are very important to succeeding in raids is the [TankSpot Project Marmot Video Raidguides](http://www.tankspot.com/forumdisplay.php?206-Project-Marmot-TankSpot-Raid-Movie-Guides) which work for all raiders, not just tanks, and have been known to explain tactics very well for bosses. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, if you haven't yet, **Learn your class.** This is crucial for maximising DPS, and it doesn't hurt to ask more experienced players for advice on maximising damage output. Also, Elitist Jerks have some good info on Rogue dps specs, rotations, glyphs, gear and how to maximise output with that. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I seriously suggest working your way up the Trial of the Champion normal/heroic and ICC 5-man normal/heroic ladder, as you can get some good Naxx to Trial of the Crusader quality epics there, as well as Emblems of Triumph.

mushroom cultivation is a good thing. however, do **NOT** eat mushrooms from the wild, that you do not know/ cannot identify. 90% of all mushrooms are poisonous, and while they are good for you, the nutritional value is less than that of plants, fruit, insects, nuts and animals.

How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of 'Dog the Bounty Hunter'. :) newlinechar  newlinechar Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying 'oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k' -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes? newlinechar  newlinechar So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???

It's hard to have a secret room of any size in a normal house though. I think most people would wonder why a part of house is accessible.

Actually it wasn't! The perils of relying on MS Word huh? newlinechar  newlinechar It would be equal to have 210 spots for everyone if Maori were equally represented socio-economically, as well as educationally (ie: poor results in high school etc). Whilst its easy to argue that Maori students should just 'do better', its not always that easy. The effect of poverty, or being poor in a relative sense, makes it very hard to achieve well scholastically. For example, if your parents are poor you will live in a poor neighborhood and attend a poorer school. Chances are you wont do as well as someone who is living in a very affluent area and has books, stationary, tuition etc all provided for them. You dont get to go to uni because your family cannot afford it (or you dont have the results), so you use your high school education, if you even have one, to get a poor paying job. Have kids, cycle repeats itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar By introducing the ability to provide free tuition or extra spots to students who make a real effort and come from a less than privileged background, the governments aim with this policy is to try and break that cycle. It may not be perfect, and relies heavily upon the individual to make the right choices and such; but its better than nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem was, this is exactly what happened previously. Look up the policies of assimilation and integration adopted by the European government.  newlinechar  newlinechar The major issue people dont seem to get it that Maori are not guaranteed a spot in the course. They still have to have the required academic results too. It is simply designed to allow additional students into the course who historically do not often get into these courses. Its designed to help alleviate the disparity between Maori and Pakeha incomes/living conditions (for lack of a better term) etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its fine to argue for equality, but be sure to remember how European settlers treated the Maori, as well as the subsequent government policies imposed, and ask yourself if that could have any future consequences.  newlinechar  newlinechar If we want to go to extremes, Pakeha are now the victims of racism.

I understand that this is a gray area concerning ownership.  I don't consider it stealing because it's something they're happy to give away for free (they distribute them on sidewalks, in schools, to military members, etc.).  I'm not taking away from anyone's livelihood, although it could be argued that it costs them a nominal amount more because of increased demand beyond those who are seriously trying to read the bible.  It's like taking a free sample in the grocery store but throwing it in the trash instead of eating it.  Except the grocery store isn't spreading ridiculous statements and stifling progress by encouraging individuals to trade reason for faith. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  Changed 'trying to stifle' to 'stifling'.  I doubt the Gideons are actively trying to stifle progress, but they are doing so regardless of whether they're aware of it or not.
Know people. All about knowing people, one minute im talking to good friend of mine, a photographer, (youll see all his new shots of Sullivan soon on which I was helping by holding a light in Sullivan's face :P) and the next we're having pork dumplings and showing each other iphone apps, then I'm cutting a showreel for him. I know that doesn't help at all, but it's pretty much how it all happened

But people are combing two separate issues now.  One being the search server is too overloaded and doesn't work or returns incomplete results.  This is not what historically people have complained about. newlinechar  newlinechar The issue with search is that when working correctly it cannot find what people want.  This is because unless what you search for was specifically in the title, you will never find it.  Reddit search only searches titles.  There is no extra keyword field to help people search for things. newlinechar  newlinechar Searching comments is also not a fix since comments don't always have relevant info in them that ties to what was being linked to.  Also a search would have no idea what comment is more relevant than the others.  So search would be largely ineffective by searching comments, because comments are all over the place.  A post about michael jackson isn't always going to have a comment that repeats the name and if not in the title, searching for michael jackson will never return that post.  And any post where someone joked about michael jackson where the link has nothing to do with michael jackson would be returned.  Search would be more of a mess by including comments.

&gt;The gameplay is the same, the weapons are the same, the strategies are the same. newlinechar  newlinechar No, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HAHAHA NO THEY ARE NOT, and eh, a few strategies carry over, but otherwise no. newlinechar  newlinechar The guns are completely different from 1.6 in every single way. Damage, spray, recoil, and accuracy off the first shot. The game play is completely changed due to the weapon. You can dominate with a p90 due to it throwing off the person's aim more than is shown. If I get an awper in the small toe with a p90 bullet they're dead as I will easily mow them up with no fear of them being able to shoot me outside of blind luck. newlinechar  newlinechar Seeing how that's just a single example, and in 1.6 the P90 was worthless... yeah, completely different games. newlinechar  newlinechar Want another one?

No, some very literally got addicted to Heroin, gradually spent their life's savings on it, alienated nearly all their friends because of it, and one eventually overdosed. newlinechar  newlinechar You tell me why a substance that can compel somebody to do that should be legal. newlinechar  newlinechar The right to ingest anything you desire does not include something that no man in their right mind would participate in if they were fully aware of what was in store for them.

I read the 'how convenient' in the voice of the [church lady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-ByoJ7amKs).  
The Buddha talked about the nature of mind, suffering, negative actions and positive actions. The points he touched on transcend any one time period and pertain more to the very nature of human beings, a nature that has remained relatively unchanged over the two and a half millenia since the Buddha passed into nirvana.  newlinechar  newlinechar Modern living teachers interpret and help implement the Buddha's teachings. In this respect they are more able to bring the teachings into the context of modern life and help others find their path to enlightenment.  newlinechar  newlinechar Finally for your last question. The Buddha taught the Dharma in India two thousand years ago. It was the path to Enlightenment, with detailed instructions on how to traverse that path and achieve the cessation of suffering. After he died three main bodies of Buddhist practice came into being. The Hinayana, to which the Theravadan belong, the Mahayana, to which Tibetan, Indian, Japanese Buddhists belong, and the Vajrayana, to which many Tibetans, Indians and Chinese belong to. All of these different paths have the ultimate goal of enlightenment at the end but they go about it differently and for different reasons. Over the past two thousand years monks, lamas, yogis, rinpoches, and Dalai Lamas have all been elaborating on and discovering new methods to bring beings to enlightenment. So when you asked if Buddhism has advanced, then yes it has. There are countless ways to achieve enlightenment each with their own guardian school or lineage. As long as these lineages are preserved and passed on they will remain available to all sentient beings.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hopefully I answered your questions. I encourage you to research on Wikipedia and sites affiliated with different Buddhist lineages.

Discussing your relationship with strangers on the internet, even if it is anonymously, is probably a riskier move than telling the truth about this situation. *'Hey, I have something to tell you... but to do it for me, here's 20 pages of people talking about us having sex.'*   newlinechar  newlinechar Just have a talk. 
&gt; Wait. Let's be real here. He is asking why they are expensive. newlinechar  newlinechar Indeed he is, so why did you take a statement I made about ease of use and apply it to the question of price? Leicas are expensive because they're made by hand, with expensive parts. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Aka, less customizable. newlinechar  newlinechar How is a Leica less customizable than any SLR? You buy a body and attach various lenses or other crap to it - every camera with interchangeable lenses and a flash shoe offer the same degree of customization. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The 5d has a better sensor. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course it does! The 5d body is huge and certainly has enough room to cram in the megapixels, but surprisingly it doesn't beat the M9 by such a massive margin. The M9 takes 5212x3472px (18mpx) large images and the 5dmkII shoots 5616x3744px (21mpx) large images - not really a big difference. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So sharp lenses on the leica are limited by the lack of detail the sensor produces. newlinechar  newlinechar This a poor argument that can be used against any digital camera ever produced. If you want to be nerdy about it you should check the MTF charts: [Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=152&amp;modelid=14259) [Leica Summilux-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH](http://en.leica-camera.com/service/downloads/lenses_for_rangefinder_cameras/summilux-m_50_mm_f14_asph/index.html) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Wow. Nice stretch. See, it doesn't have autofocus issues because it doesn't have autofocus. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't really much of a stretch at all, it's just logic. Because rangefinders have a different fundamental approach to capturing an image they allow lens designers to perfect a simple lens design rather than struggle with a complex one. I've never been too fond of AF and prefer rangefinder focusing, so I'm perfectly willing to trade autofocus for image quality. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's a luxury item because of the utility it had in the street-photography days of Cartier-Bresson. newlinechar  newlinechar I've covered this earlier, but if you want to get into the definition of luxury items let's compare the camera world to the car world. Porsche make about [100,000](http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/26/news/international/gumbel_porsche.fortune/index.htm) cars per year and Toyota make about [9 million](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4311878/Toyota-overtakes-GM-as-worlds-largest-car-manufacturer.html) - a ratio of 1/90. Leica is rumored to produce around 10000 M9s per year and Canon sold about [4 million cameras](http://www.canon.com/ir/annual/index.html) in 2008 - a ratio of 1/400. So does this prove that an M9 can be viewed as more exclusive and luxurious than a Porsche? Not really, but you exaggerated your point, so I'm exaggerating mine. For me, it's not even about owning a peice of luxury, it's about owning a machine I like taking pictures with. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; They are no longer a luxury item, no longer without competition newlinechar  newlinechar Remind me who else competes on the digital rangefinder market? The M9 is the only choice for consumers who are interested in this particular kind of camera DNA. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, they don't. When you compare format-to-format, digital wins. newlinechar  newlinechar Most people agree that there is about 22 to 25 megapixels of useful information in a frame of 35mm film, so I agree that digital has matched 35mm film when it comes to information density. But there isn't a single full frame 35mm digital camera that can beat the exposure latitude of film. Most DSLRs offer 8-9 stops, and the high end might reach 11 stops. Film, however, does 13-14 stops out of the box and can pull off 20 stops when [processed correctly](http://figitalrevolution.com/2009/12/07/20-stop-dynamic-range-technique-tmy2-tmax400-pmk-kodak-leica/). I'm not going to bother arguing 35mm against medium format, but film still wins that game too. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Digital surged ahead of film in terms of color accuracy nearly a decade ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Color accuracy became a non issue as soon as computers perfected the art and expanded the possibilities. Any RAW file will be just as good as any scanned negative after both have been processed. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar After all is said and done, I've come to realize that arguing RF against SLR is pointless. It all comes down to personal preferences that are informed by your particular brand of photographic philosophy. Personally, I appreciate the simple, yet precise and uncluttered approach to photography rangefinder cameras offer. Once I mastered the simple interface I realized that I was enjoying photography much more and I think it's because there is less camera between myself and the photographs I take. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Just to be clear. I agree that the camera is crazy expensive, but any M9 owner will tell you it's worth it (not to mention the massive backorders every major camera store has). If anything, Leica found the perfect price.

Hey, a tf2 player!
I'll happily grant you the equivocation of terms with 'reason', not for any malicious intent, but simply because I'm not a phenomenal wordsmith. I admit, upon re-reading that I don't well define the difference between 'reason' as 'general purpose' (this is the one I intended to discuss) and 'reason' as a synonym for 'why'. Truly sorry!   newlinechar    newlinechar When it comes to baseless assumptions, I would say that while it does seem to be the case at first glance, I *myself* tried my hardest not to make any assumptions. My opinion toward the subject stems from my studies of philosophers, many of whom could be argued against in their own right. However, maybe there is something specific I could try to address? And that way, if I can't address it, I'll have learned that I did, in fact, accidentally make an assumption.   newlinechar    newlinechar As for philosophical misunderstandings, I would argue that all philosophers have multiple intents and multiple views of the world. The one that I, myself, would criticize is how I treated Nietzsche's hypothetical attitude toward his own idea of true nihilism (as compared to what I learned as 'soft nihilism', which is the attitude Nietzche opposed - that of thinking that if life is meaningless, we should stop caring about it). Nietzche was a proponent of embracing the meaninglessness and utter torment of life; but at least in my opinion, doing so is an indication of how humans cannot cope with facing this truth, and doing so on repeat for all eternity.   newlinechar    newlinechar To be fair, then, I would retract the part of my argument in which I incorporated Nietzche's belief. In this respect, I agree that this could be a misunderstanding and would be simply considered a fallacious appeal to authority.   newlinechar    newlinechar    newlinechar As for the rest of the response, I would love to continue to examine particulars, in favor of further critique.

However, the whole effort to open up Swiss bank accounts is an attack on Swiss sovereignty. chiguy was completely wrong about 'if they don't want to play by the rules in America...' because they are playing by the Swiss rules in Switzerland. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they should get kicked out from using dollar which is American currency. newlinechar  newlinechar Americans can't 'kick someone out from using the dollar.'

Government *can*, when applied poorly, exacerbate any problem. Those on the left side of spectrum (like myself) would do well to keep this in mind always. newlinechar  newlinechar Some of us do understand that much of the policy schemes we come up with amount to an imposition. We are, I think, nonetheless certain that there exists a public good that should be expressed in the rules we design for ourselves as a society. I would love to see libertarians stop arguing about the philosophical underpinnings of government, and start using the policy we have every right to create in the aid of the less fortunate...even if its something like charter schools or the one realm where we agree: Foreign policy and the pursuit of peace.  newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, I think the reflexive focus on never ever ever admitting a regulation or tax has a legitimate use helps no one, even libertarians themselves. It makes brushing you aside easy. We just label you as unable to negotiate in good faith and largely an unreasonable lot. Not that that's fair, but this is politics.

Interesting report thanks.  But missing is any discussion of Target's apparently poor ability to estimate how much of a product to stock based on past sales.  It mystifies me how/why a store that consistently sells out of product X won't simply stock more of product X until it stops selling out of it.  Seeing empty shelves doesn't make me want to buy other stuff in a store; it simply makes me curse the waste of time and gas and want to shop elsewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar What it really reminds me of is the stories that used to float around the U.S. about stores in the U.S.S.R. seemingly stocked with empty shelves.  I don't just see it in Target; throughout the northeast U.S. I see it in grocery stores, Kmarts, Home Depots, Sears, on and on.  The big chains seem to be unable simply to keep products in stock.  This more than anything causes me to buy online.  So we may be seeing the death spiral of retailers just like we've seen with newspapers.  As soon as some entrepreneur figures out how to run a grocery store online, that'll be the end of brick &amp; mortar grocery stores too.

You don't just mean black people, because includes Aboriginal Australians, Middle Easterners, Southern Asians (primarily Indians), and African-Europeans.

No, why would they get scholarships?

I worked help desk at a large university that had this same policy. It was the bane of our existence. First someone calls and is pissed off because their password isn't working (it's never that they forgot it, someone it's always that the system messed up). Then we get a nice earful after they realize that they can't use the same password again (yes, this same person that insisted they were typing their password correctly before, now actually *is* typing it correctly when they try to re-use as their new password. Oh the irony). newlinechar  newlinechar The only argument for this policy I can see is a case where someone gains access to an account and uses it in such a manner that the owner of the account doesn't notice someone else is using it. After (at most) 3 months, the intruder no longer has access. However, I fail to see how this case justifies forcing 80,000 people to change their password every 3 months.

I'm more of a centrist (with many center-left and center-right policies), so I disagree with both sides in general. However I think the Left's policies, primarily of the Liberals, has been exacerbating problems both on a national scale for countries and on a global scale. newlinechar  newlinechar Multiculturalism is a naive, unscientific, and illogical ideology that ignores basic biology, genetics and anthropology; it creates more racial tensions and destroys genetics, cultures and languages. If someone wants 'multiculturalism' then they should look at our planet, we already are a multicultural species; cooperation between different races, ethnicities and cultures has been increasing as more and more countries become developed. We don't need multiculturalism in our countries, we need to preserve all our unique peoples, their cultures and their languages; we are entirely capable of living together and cooperating as a species on a planetary and interplanetary level. I also see it as necessary, as we may encounter an extraterrestrial species one day; if we don't encounter any, we still will have to deal with the guaranteed differences in our species (like on Earth) that will arise from the separation issues that come from colonizing new planets and star systems. newlinechar  newlinechar I attribute most of the world's poverty to the Liberal governments over the last half century providing welfare to poor countries, and the occasional meddling in politics due to rampant Corporatism in attempts to exploit natural resources in their countries. The welfare just exacerbates their problems as they have no incentive to become self-sufficient, and they have a lot more children while there is a constant supply of free food, which just makes the entire situation worse and worse as the aid will just increase to compensate. We should be providing knowledge and training, and perhaps giving equipment/animals/plants out on loan so that people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, so to speak. This will also help those people develop pride in what they've accomplished, helping them in the long run.
Most password storage mechanisms include the salt with the hash.  The main purpose of the salt is to make things like [rainbow tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) not worthwhile.

I actually don't know what hash function the number 6 indicates, I was somewhat surprised that my system isn't using MD5.  It's probably SHA-512 or something.
It doesn't. You gain the votes of the winners, you lose the votes of the losers.

I don't know about you, but renewables are not economically viable. As a nation, we already burn a ton of coal for our power -- is researching to improve this a bad thing? If research into carbon sequestration and sulfur scrubbing can make a huge difference on our overall CO2 emissions as a nation (and use electricity generated from this instead of burning gasoline), maybe that's a better solution. Incremental change works, and just because Clean Coal currently doesn't exist doesn't mean we shouldn't fund research for it.

because either the world will fall down and all anyone will care about is the scraps of carrion they can wrestle from the other crazed beasts or the modernization of the world will rapidly increase in pace with the internet all all that business which will allow people to realize that much of the insanity of the old world was due to out dated dogma which regardless of religion, political opinion, etc is quiet simply wrong - not saying people will absolve their religion and partisan preference but universally all the modes of thought will HAVE to include the new truths, such as how no one seriously believes in magic yet less than a hundred years ago many people seriously believed in occult powers and mystic love potions.  This process will increase and expand, the idea that a nude body is offensive will sound as absurd as ankle clips do today (for those that don't know an ankle clip is what stops under trousers separate from the sock so in the unlikely event of the lower portion of the dress being raised the ankle won't be exposed, this is but one of many, many devices used to maintain 'modesty' in repressed era england) - from the full length garments of not so long ago to the hot pants and oh so sexy short black dresses i see every time i'm out with the party crowds -we've gone from being 2inches of exposed flesh to 2 inches of concealed flesh.   newlinechar    newlinechar Head over to r/gonewild or yuvutu or xtube or any of the other sites that let people show off their nude bodies, they all contain a constant flow of nudity and ask (mostly) nothing in return - the most telling thing in my mind is the absence of heads in many of the pics, people personally don't mind sharing their nudity with people and yet they know that *society* might see it in a different light... That slow switch from prude to nude will happen on a society wide basis, maybe first the popular consensus will accept that people who want to be nude or exhibit themselves are 'normal' then they'll accept slower still that just laying around in the sun nude doesn't have to be a sexual thing....  or maybe it'll be a sudden flash moment and everyone will come out the closet together, nude beach popularity will soar and in a few short seasons the frequency of nudity on the beach, heath or sunbathing haven will grow faster than pokemon or yoyo's.  What ever happens, it will happen - we used to be scared to admitting we were animals because that made the world so much more scary, now we're starting to understand and revel in the beauty of ourselves and each other - elitist culture is being replaces by popular culture where rather than someone who tries their hardest to appear above humanity is less interesting than a jade goody character who was every bit as human as the day she was born.   newlinechar      newlinechar We have in short a world where people have been repressed for a long time, we're waking up and shrugging off the old world - how silly does it seem in light of thermo nucler war, water on mars, climate change,. democracy and all the other wonders the modern world dreams of to say that bare flesh is anything but bare flesh?   newlinechar    newlinechar A world where diamonds and gold no longer make sense, where information is free to everyone - all the works of the greats can be accessed in an [instant](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and every day more amazingness is added to our [world](http://www.ted.com/), where we all pretty much agree all humans are equal and  opinions differ.... can you really imagine this world revolving fifty more times around the sun and still anyone remembering why we found skin so scary to look at? will those sining demons or morality enforcing traditions which we don't even remember enough about now to understand still bite at societies bare ankles when we live in a post-hydrocarbon world? a world where robotics and AI (evolutionary CAD is ALREADY designing vital bits for NASA) have radically changed our concepts of work? where internet, VR, social networking, etc have totally changed the structure of society?   newlinechar    newlinechar I'm not Nostradamus but you don't need to be a soothsayer to see what's already happening in this world, i can't see how the fear of nudity could possible last fifty years, i'll be shocked it it lasts twenty.

&gt; I never once made a moral claim for society to the property. I said property rights only exist within society. That is an amoral statement. newlinechar  newlinechar You are making the claim implicitly by stating that society has a right to control a given geographic region. That is the definition of ownership. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is no moral right to property as ownership can never be historically established. Numerous bits of property were taken violently, coercively, or illegally at some point in history and it is dishonest to enter the debate tabula rasa. Someone else 'owned' your property before you. You only have claim to that property now because society recognizes it as yours. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you claiming that morality is objective? newlinechar  newlinechar That the property I am on now might have been coercively obtained at some point in the past does not invalidate my claim ipso facto. It must be shown by the victim that it was illegitimately taken from him at some point in time. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I might steal a watch from you. While I have illegitimately obtained this watch and violated your property right, you might decide that the watch was cheap and not worth getting it back. While I may still have this watch illegitimately, that my claim to ownership goes undisputed, it may be assumed that I own it. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said, ownership and property are merely constructs used to outline a framework with which to handle conflict. But a conflict arises only when two parties have a dispute in the other's claim to ownership. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Otherwise an American Indian somewhere could walk onto your land and start a very legitimate war with you. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, but it is rather unlikely that anyone would be able to prove who the original owner is. When the owner of a piece of property is unknown, it might as well be assumed to be unowned. In which case, it can be homesteaded. (Like an abandoned house or plot of land, for example.)

In response to your edit, I am *not* just burning these bibles.  I did burn one, but that was for (mostly) practical purposes.  I am looking for something more constructive to do with them that also fits in with my atheism.  Anyway, here's my response to your statements: newlinechar  newlinechar The Gideons give bibles to anyone who asks for them, regardless of their motives.  I certainly don't doubt that the Gideons would be very unhappy with my use of their product.  But they are, ostensibly, giving them to me by putting them in my hotel room.  If someone was handing out Nazi (or creationist, or Velikovskian, etc.) pamphlets and they sincerely believed what was in them, would you have a problem with people accepting them and then using them to create an exhibit mocking those beliefs? newlinechar  newlinechar I think everyone, superficially, has a problem with desecrating books.  But can you honestly say that *every* book ever written deserves preservation just because it was printed?  I'm currently reading *Exploring the Levels of Creation* by Sylvia Browne.  It's absolute rubbish.  Reading it sheds some light on pseudoscience and the human condition and little else.  I would rejoice if all record of it was wiped from the earth.  I wouldn't advocate that it be illegal to print and distribute, though.  However, I think I should be allowed to do what I want with my copy of it. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not in total disagreement with what you're saying.  Book burning and desecration is a slippery slope.  I don't believe I'm doing this just for the purpose of desecration, though.  I would hope that what I choose to do with these bibles will show that the bible is no different from any book and that questioning it or discarding is not something we should fear.  And I'm certainly not advocating that it shouldn't be allowed to be printed or distributed.  I do appreciate your criticism, though, and I sincerely welcome your response.

I checked out the link.  Still doesn't make sense.  So the way you describe it, the bondsman takes on 0 risk.  The municipality sets a $100k bond.  The bondsman takes $15k from the perp and uses this amount to give to the municipality.  If the perp returns for the court date, the bondsman gets his $15k back and thus 'earns $15k'... but for doing what??  If the perp doesn't show up, the bondsman simple doesn't get his $15k back (that he didn't have in the first place prior to this arrangement), thus netting him $0... no gain/no loss.

Sorry: I can't remember his opening. This happened more than 30 years ago, and I've played lots of chess games over my life (99% of them in my youth). I don't think the game lasted more than three hours. It might have even lasted as little as under an hour, but the tension and stakes make it seem longer in recollection than it was. He wasn't a bad player. He apparently had quite a few games under his own belt. Hence, his desire to play: he thought he held an advantage. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I was a bit distracted by the fact that any moment we might pitch the table sideways and be trying to kill each other.

[Oregon Death with Dignity Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Death_with_Dignity_Act) newlinechar  newlinechar Under the law, a capable adult Oregon resident who has been diagnosed, by a physician, with a terminal illness that will kill the patient within six months may request in writing, from his or her physician, a prescription for a lethal dose of medication for the purpose of ending the patient's life. Exercise of the option under this law is voluntary and the patient must initiate the request. Any physician, pharmacist or healthcare provider who has moral objections may refuse to participate. newlinechar  newlinechar The request must be confirmed by two witnesses, at least one of whom is not related to the patient, is not entitled to any portion of the patient's estate, is not the patient's physician, and is not employed by a health care facility caring for the patient. After the request is made, another physician must examine the patient's medical records and confirm the diagnosis. The patient must be determined to be free of a mental condition impairing judgment. If the request is authorized, the patient must wait at least fifteen days and make a second oral request before the prescription may be written. The patient has a right to rescind the request at any time. Should either physician have concerns about the patient's ability to make an informed decision, or feel the patient's request may be motivated by depression or coercion, the patient must be referred for a psychological evaluation. newlinechar  newlinechar The law protects doctors from liability for providing a lethal prescription for a terminally ill, competent adult in compliance with the statute's restrictions. Participation by physicians, pharmacists, and health care providers is voluntary. The law also specifies a patient's decision to end his or her life shall not 'have an effect upon a life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy.'
women are still paid less than men for the same job so their are some inequalities that need to be dealt with and education is a great place to do ir. and even if at New Trier affirmative action gets skewed, at my school (south side of Chicago 95% black 80% free lunch) it is hugley important and allows alot of smart people who never would have other wise been able to go to college go to college. their parents didnt have that opportunity(for the most part). parental education level has huge impact on student test scores. lower education of parents = worse results on test scores. the national poverty rate for black people is 25 % for hispancis 23 % for white people 9 % so the need is much greater.

Unskilled labor does not remain unskilled (unless the person is unwilling of course). Jobs that you would normally consider 'unskilled' are all part of the process of gaining experience. After gaining said experience, it's easier to move up the ladder to jobs that require more and more skills. If this weren't so, people who worked at McDonalds after graduating high school (for whatever reason) would be stuck there their entires lives, but you know that's not the norm. People who want to work hard and succeed will gain the experience and skills they need to progress up the ladder.

I got sober in AA at the age of 19. I had a 'higher power' that I did not really define. I would pray and do the 12-step stuff and talk about God this and God that. Incidentally, most people in 12-step programs who use the term *higher power* really mean *Christian Concept of God But Really Nice*. Almost 21 years later, I am an atheist and I am still sober. It was a gradual thing. I still go to AA meetings about once a week but when people talk about God, I really don't pay attention. My current theory is that people who pray are really just processing troublesome emotions like worry, fear, anger, etc. This emotional discharge frees the mind a little bit, providing the opportunity for better decision making. I have no science to back this up. It's just a guess. 
what?

The people who are most memorable for me, probably wouldn't be the people you notice. The people I remember are the ones that break the spanging (or panhandling) rules. There are only 3 rules, so it shouldn't be that hard: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Don't ask people for change if they are homeless, or used to be. It's a sign of disrespect. newlinechar 2. Don't ask people with kids for money, or pregnant women. I think the thought behind this rule is that they should be spending their money on their kids. newlinechar 3. Don't ask disabled people for change. Duh. newlinechar  newlinechar So when someone I knew when I was homeless asks me, I get pissed the fuck off. We get into it sometimes, it's just disrespectful.. sometimes they'll call me names like oogle cause I got off the streets. That's about the worst thing you can call another homeless kid. newlinechar  newlinechar I sorta answer the westlake question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/aweof/i_was_a_street_kid_in_seattle_in_2000_ask_me/c0jqy6b) but really I just can't stand those kids. Most of them are old foster kids.. they are just too young and stupid to blend in on the hill. A lot of the juggalos hang out there too. Some of these kids just come from the drop in centers down there like Orion Center, which closes at 7pm and they just have nothing else to do before they go sleep outside or go home. The shelters are all closing by 8pm, so those aren't shelter kids at night. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to work at Orion Center actually when I was 16-17.. and a lot of those kids decided they were in a gang called the OC gang, and they had a rivalry with another drop in center that was open later. They always did stupid shit like this, I don't understand it. newlinechar  newlinechar No clue on Mr. Payphone. :P

I am open to arguments, but I like evidence even better. I am trying to get people here to see that there are real problems with their ideas, not simply that the rest of us are lazy statists/leftists. From my view politics is like engineering, an issue of practicality. Politics is about making things work, enabling large groups of people to live together. Sure, it would be nice if everything worked without having some organization and 'authority' entity. But I seriously don't see that happening. So I asked people for examples of their ideas in action. If they don't exists, then ask yourself why. If you have an answer, then give it too me. But if you don't know why there has never been a long term (over a few generations) stable anarchic society (and, no, tribal societies don't count) then don't try to convince me to try it.  newlinechar  newlinechar And if that is not sufficient, then how about this.

About the only thing true about your entire comment is that the US government could possibly revoke the UBS license to operate in America.

&gt;Those who believe that math has corrupted economics don't really understand how the math is used. No economist (no good economist, anyway) treats the math as anything but a means to better understanding and communication, and the best economists are the ones who are able to extract the meaning (the 'intuition') from the mathematical results newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, I think you have it backwards. I think the best economists are those who can coherently communicate relevant results to those who can use them (policy makers). This usually involves little to no math.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, a lot of models are built to construct a mathematical logic to support intuition. Take trade theory. Hecksher-Olin models dominated for while because they made mathematical sense. Empirically though it was a massive failure. Modern trade theories such as gravity models started as empirically sound but had very little theory to justify them. Theory was then developed to support the results.    newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at the math in [Akrelof (1970)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons), a foundational paper for the study of asymmetrical info (he won the Nobel prize with Stiglitz and Spence for his work in this area), the algebra is nothing a 7th grader couldn't do, and the statistics aspect is almost nil (calculating expected values from a uniform distribution).  newlinechar  newlinechar Generally you need esoteric math for esoteric economics.

He would tell me about how everyone inside the turret had to cover their ears or else the concussion would do some serious damage.  Of course this was back in the day when men were men and didn't need hearing protection.
maybe. I was under the impression that all the guys in the mission were poached from a wide variety of military backgrounds.  That is how those super secret black ops things work, I hear. I can't remember if he spoke, but if he had a British accent, then you are probably right. 
Hahaha that is incredibly dimwitted. I was under the impression that homeopathic treatments were just treatments that aren't universally recognized as beneficial, like acupuncture and the like.

Why do you think that? First, under ideal circumstances, we can vitrify the brain. Second, you don't have to preserve the brain in working condition... you just have to stop the brain information from being lost to entropy. In other words, you just have to preserve it well enough that given full nanotech, super sophisticated neuroscience, etc, we can some day go in and say 'there's a bit of braincell here such and such distance this other bit of braincell here and so and so remaining concentration of some neurotransmiter or other. Since it's in this area of the brain, that implies it was probably set up like this, which means given the nearness to that it was connected like so, etc etc...' newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't have to be preserved in working condition... Just has to be preserved well enough that all the king's superintelligent cyberhorses can put humpty dumpty back together again.

On book destruction: I'm not against book burning simply because it's a book and printed content somehow gets some sort of free ride, I'm against it because it's the destruction of information and ideas, even if the information and ideas are crazy. I'm of the belief that is someone says something crazy, you don't silence them, or their print. Instead, you refute it using your own free speech. Destroying Bibles to combat the radical beliefs of Christianity is futile. There are more Bibles in the world than people. I think your time and effort would be better spent spreading your own information and ideas, rather than destroying others'. Instead of going to the effort of destroying Bibles, leave an Atheist flier, pamphlet, or book. Fight ideas with ideas, not with fire.

First, slavery was an integral part of the American economy during the slave trade. I’ve read some papers that go so far as to say the American economy was built off of the slave trade. It appears the American version of history is a little different then the version they teach in Canada.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I’m not saying all white people are rich. I grew up in ingleside (pop ~2200), moved to the city when I was 8. We were poor but my family managed just fine (exceptionally well I should say). I’m nearly done uni now and haven’t had any problems with scholarships. in fact I was essentially paid to go to school; more scholarships then tuition. None of them white only.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My point is that there are far less poor white people then poor African Americans, I see no problem with providing African Americans with **extra financial help** in comparison to other groups. Whites don’t need **extra financial help**, there are plenty of scholarship out there.    newlinechar  newlinechar I have also witnessed some disgusting, racist acts that 'Billy Bob' doesn't have to worry about. Maybe its different in Canada but ive never experienced or seen the discrimination against rural people you talk about.  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: i should also say that i respect your viewpoint, although i disagree, and think this is an issue our society should discuss more.

Renewables already exist and their price has gone down over time. The price for solar makes is ~11cents/KwH which IS price competitive. Wind is already at the same price point as coal and is easily installed in a variety of environments.

Although I see what @gamblekat is saying, I don't think he's accurate.

&gt;Would you consider committing a crime again or did this experience totally freak you out? newlinechar  newlinechar I never considered drug dealing a crime, but whatever.

&gt; that prohibition doesn't effectively prevent addiction. newlinechar  newlinechar How in the world can you make that assertion when it has never been legalized? newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, I know you can use example countries, however what works in one nation will not necessarily work in another, if reading the news every day has taught me anything at all. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe Prohibition coupled with education and a much more effective fight against organized crime in relation to drugs is the way to go (admittedly, a major reason why we're struggling is because of rampant corruption and horrible organization). newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I don't know of anyone who can say they use harder drugs regularly and with self-control. The drugs are by their very physical composition incredibly addicting. It is not something somebody with a lot of willpower can just have control over. It is *physically* addicting. newlinechar  newlinechar

Just because I'm destroying bibles doesn't mean that I can't also spread my own ideas.  That's like saying you can only have a sports team that either plays offense or defense, but never both.  I take most every opportunity I can to offer up my views on science and rationalism.  I do like your idea of leaving an atheist flier, pamphlet, or book in a hotel room.  Whether I also take the bible from the hotel room is a separate issue.  One could certainly argue that it makes atheists look like jerks if they take bibles from hotel rooms, and one could argue that it is wrong to do so because those bibles weren't expressly given out for that purpose. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm hoping that taking some sort of action with these bibles will help to spread my ideas.  I'm not doing it just for the sake of removing a set of information of which innumerable copies exist.  Like I said in a previous post, I hope that I will show that the bible is no different from any other book and that questioning it, discarding it, or destroying it is not something we should fear. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Once again, I'd like to emphasize that I'm not burning books.  And even if I were, I'm destroying books that belong to me (arguably...but would you have the same problems if I bought the book on Amazon?).  Of course it is wrong to destroy another person's book, but is it wrong to destroy a book that belongs to you? newlinechar  newlinechar Pre-post edit/TL;DR:  It's not like this is the last copy of the bible in existence.  I would have a problem with destroying that.  But this is something that people have a problem with destroying for reasons other than the fact that it's a book.  To them, it's a *holy* book.  To me, it's not.  I'm trying to figure out a way to demonstrate *that it's just a book.*
I'm still (at this very moment) using a Thinkpad I bought almost ten years ago.

It's a really smart, durable computer, though it's old-fashioned-looking. newlinechar  newlinechar And trackpoints are much less frustrating than touchpads, imo.

&gt; I think the best economists are those who can coherently communicate relevant results to those who can use them (policy makers). newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, I think that those who can extract the intuition from the math are generally going to be better at communicating that intuition to non-economists, for one and the same reason: they understand the ideas better. newlinechar  newlinechar But I was referring more to academic economics when I stated that the math is used for communication. For two academic economists, who both speak the language of math already, math can be a very effective way of communicating an idea. But, obviously, the same doesn't apply when talking to a politician.

&gt;What do you like in a portfolio site?   newlinechar  newlinechar I like clean, focused sites. It gives me the impression that the photographer has a specialty, and that's what he/she wants you to see. A photographer whose site only has Fashion/Product/Lifestyle or Wildlife/Landscape or Street/Event says 'professional' to me instantly, rather than a site that has Portrait/Maternity/Wedding/Landscape/Architecture/Product/Flowers. That says to me, 'I will shoot anything out of desperation,' or 'Jack of all trades, master of none.' Of course, that's if the idea is to market yourself as a professional, for hire photographer. If you just want a place to dump photos and show your friends, then go nuts.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Should I use flash or just html and/or php?   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know why photographers, people engaging in a visual medium, gravitate toward the tackiest site designs imaginable. Keep it HTML and valid CSS. If you need it to do wacky stuff, jQuery and Ajax. If I go to a photographer's site and have to wait through a crazy loading bar or a pretentious intro, I leave. Even worse is a load time every time you click an image, or music and/or sound effects, or the site resizing my browser window without my permission.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would like it to be easily updatable - what are your thoughts on wordpress?   newlinechar  newlinechar Wordpress is a brilliant backend for a blog, but is not designed with photography in mind. I post galleries to my self-hosted Wordpress blog from time to time, but it's a bit of a chore. There are themes and templates geared toward photography, but you still have a lot of clunky stuff going on in the background that you're not using. I ran a photoblog on [Pixelpost](http://www.pixelpost.org/) for a while and really liked it. Templates are static, but it makes for simple and easy customization of your pages. Like Wordpress, there are plugins available to add functionality. There is also [Cheesecake](http://cheesecake-photoblog.org/), though I've never used it and can't personally vouch for it.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This tool built by danwin looks cool, but it's flash - thoughts?   newlinechar  newlinechar Simple and clean, but again, nothing that couldn't be done with jQuery. In a world of iPod/iPhone/iPad, I say alienate as few viewers as possible.

Well, the nuclear war plan during the cold war was that the tankers would go up to almost the North Pole refueling the bombers that were inbound to the USSR.   newlinechar  newlinechar By the time the tankers turned around to head to a recovery base, the Soviet ICBM's would have done their work, and we'd have to use the sextant just to get to any airstrip after topping off the bombers.  So it wasn't necessarily to go on fighting. newlinechar  newlinechar And, sorry for the grammar Nazism, but it's moral**e**.

Fun fact: the *New York Times* has a policy that acronyms spelling a pronounceable word are printed in all caps, with no periods (NATO, AIDS). Initialisms are printed with periods between the letters (M.P.G., P.C., I.B.M.) newlinechar  newlinechar However, there are weird exceptions to this rule fucking *everywhere*, for all kinds of impossible to remember reasons. “TV” is spelled without periods, because (the logic goes) it stands for one word, television, not “Tele Vision.” If it were “T.V.”, the first period would interrupt the solid word. “DVD” (digital videodisc) is another exception for the same reason—no gap between V and the second D. newlinechar  newlinechar Acronyms of more than four letters, but *not* initialisms, are spelled in title case as regular proper nouns. Thus we have “U.S.P.T.O.”, but, bizarrely, “Nafta,” “Unicef,” and “Acorn.” This is for no reason other than to prevent the reader’s eye catching on blocks of capital letters—this keeps the text easily scannable. Four-letter acronyms are discouraged for the same reason, actually. So instead of spreading “AIDS” everywhere, you want to occasionally substitute “the virus.” newlinechar  newlinechar What about “AARP”? Well, in *that* case, “AARP” in all caps is actually the official name of the organization; it doesn’t stand for anything anymore. Before they changed it in the ’90s, the *Times* used to call it “A.A.R.P.” in print. The same logic holds for the names of television networks. Thus, the “N.A.A.C.P.” might protest businesses remaining open on “M.L.K.” day, but Hurley dies on the upcoming sixth season of *Lost* on “ABC”. newlinechar  newlinechar So that’s the general idea. Only in the cases where adhering to this practice would result in awkward spellings like C.D.-ROM, with a mix of the two, do they resort to popular usage. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, working the copy desk at the *Times* is a real peach. \*gunshot\*

DMing player property is hard, I discovered. newlinechar  newlinechar I was stupid and answered one question wrong: 'Can we keep the abandoned keep we just cleared the orcs out of?' A simple small-sized castle I did on graph paper. I planned it to be a couple night thing. yeah. I let 'em keep it, and this is what I discovered: newlinechar  newlinechar You lose a lot of motivation for your characters, as they don't need money (the property usually produces it), and they now have a place to store all their trinkets, so they end up usually having a massive stockpile of magical weapons, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Mages have a place to store and use resources to research spells. newlinechar Warriors can raise an army, your clerics can start a temple, woodsy types get antsy about all the civilization going on, dwarves start digging mines or never come out of the forge, people just get settled.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then there's the management. Someone's got to do the bookkeeping, and the characters, who are already usually the richest people for miles, become the biggest employer in the region. Also there's the logical political and social consequences of a new economic/magical power in the region, if you want to get into that. I did. It was actually fun for a while, but it got mindboggling. They wanted to raise an army, started getting ideas about taking over surrounding territory, all that jazz. It was beginning to be hard to justify why I kept saying no, and saying yes would mean running my players' effect on the economy society and history of an entire region of my game world. newlinechar  newlinechar It can lead to a lot of awesome roleplaying, but I'm not sure it's still D&amp;D when you're negotiating property rights with the local liege, deciding henchman's wages, what to do with the portal to the negative material plane your mage opened in her lab, mustering up a militia to go fight off the local orc infestation once and for all, and how to keep the cleric from raising 30 dead villagers a month and becoming a messiah. newlinechar  newlinechar The good news is, you can then burn it all down or destroy it, and they will rage for campaign after campaign for revenge and to get a shadow of it back. That's exactly what I did. I popped some Illithids under their little castle home, destroyed or stole most of their stuff while they were out, and let them know exactly who did it and where in the underdark they could be found. newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't see daylight for months.

It's okay - there's a perfect forth between A440 and the E below it so you can actually tune either. newlinechar  newlinechar You might also tune to the buzz tone (the other interfering 350Hz tone) to E, though it's a little bit higher than the standard E would be, which will just make you sound slightly tinnier. newlinechar  newlinechar Fun fact: the Berlin Philharmonic used to tune to A435 and a major Tokyo Orchestra used to tune to A448. The differences in tone, which you almost cannot hear, gave the Tokyo orchestra a tinny sound and the Berlin Philharmonic the typical Germanic Big Boomy Sound.

We should judge mathematical models based on their predictive capability rather than how closely it is related reality. &lt;- that Friedman quote heh.  newlinechar  newlinechar This does not mean that we should put faith into our models heh, which is exactly the point.

That's a bit shady.  You quoted out of context to make your argument.  He continues to say: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It doesn’t affect how fast an attacker can try a candidate password, given the hash and the salt from your database. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is absolutely correct.

Salting makes absolutely no difference in this scenario.   newlinechar  newlinechar And once again, he never says that unique salts are not an improvement or shouldn't be done.  He's simply saying that they are still subject to dictionary/brute force attacks and that there is a better way. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; If we use your analogy, then let's assume that you have your life's savings in a bank account -- would you keep your routing number, account number and pin in your wallet? Of course not. newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, if we're going to throw around the word 'strawman', this might be a good place to apply it.  I certainly didn't say that you should write down everything necessary to access your account and put it in your wallet.  But I certainly think it's a better idea to write down a complex password than to use a poor one. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's asinine to think that writing things down and keeping them on your person (as in the case with credit cards) is secure. newlinechar  newlinechar Strange then that numerous security experts recommend writing down passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Do you think that it's acceptable for secret service agents to write down their passwords and keep them in their wallet? their desk? a locked filing cabinet? newlinechar  newlinechar Do I think that Secret Service agents should write down their passwords and put them in their pockets?  No.  But then I hardly think your Amazon account and the President of the United States should receive the same level of security.  If you don't want to build a strawman argument, then *why are you doing it*? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It may very well be preferable in this false dilemma to write down the password. I can't safe for sure because we would have to look at the system as a whole (where exactly is the piece of paper stored, who has access to it, is there external access to the login system?, etc.) newlinechar  newlinechar How is there any mystery about what kind of systems we're discussing?  We're talking about corporate intranets and online accounts (bank, Google, Paypal, etc.).  These are the secure systems that normal people interact with.  The place I said to store the password is in their wallet, with their credit cards.  Access to the password is limited to those with access to the wallet.  We aren't talking about the NSA and the Secret Service.  We're talking about your uncle Joe and Amazon. newlinechar  newlinechar There's no one from the Secret Service reading Reddit for security advice, so I see no value in qualifying everything I say.  'X is great, unless you work for a super-secret agency and also happen to be stupid enough to be getting security tips from random people online.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; However, back to the main point, these aren't the only two alternatives. It is quite possible to have an easy-to-remember password that is long enough to be secure. The most common technique is to simply write a sentence: newlinechar  newlinechar We can argue about what people 'should' do, but it's not an especially valuable exercise.  Yes, they 'should' memorize 40-character passphrases, because it's more secure.  However, a lot of sites (including banks), don't allow really long passwords (or special characters), even though they should.  More importantly, *most people will not memorize an extremely long or complicated password, regardless of whether it's more secure*.  If it's a choice between someone memorizing '1985suzy' or writing down '#4gf6$9knhKJHg', they are better off with the written password. newlinechar 
Damn, my sarcasm was wasted.
'Dot-com” is hyphenated at the *Times* copy desk, as the noun refers to a single entity (a concept). Most other papers have decapitalized “website,” but at the *Times*, “Web site” remains for reasons mysterious to me. “Internet” is also still capitalized, though publications as exalted and sober-minded as the *Financial Times* have dropped capitalization (decapitalizing “internet” seems to be a mostly European thing, so far). So the *Times* would print “Credible Web sites on the Internet suggest that Vladimir kills himself after the C.T.U. raids,” while the *Guardian* (U.K.) would decapitalize “internet” and “website” and print the latter as a single word.

Sure, they need to be questioning it already, but a lot of people have questions in the back of their minds. You need to try to reach in and tap into that. Pull those questions out into the open. Spreading FUD about Mormonism won't work. You should know that, since you were once a Mormon. Putting up websites about 'The Dark Truth Behind Secret Mormon Rituals' isn't going to accomplish anything. Posting mocking links and talking about how stupid Mormons are on Reddit isn't going to accomplish anything. It'll just put Mormons on the defensive, making them dig their trenches of faith even deeper.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you talk about how dumb the church is to active members, you completely undermine your cause. If you talk to people outside of the church and give them a one-sided account about how crazy and manipulative Mormons are, they're eventually going to come across a few Mormons and find out that they're actually generally nice people, thus disproving in their minds what you told them. newlinechar  newlinechar So you need to take it easy. If you haven't gotten over the natural anger stage of leaving the church, then maybe you just need some more time. If you feel you must fight the church, do it in a way that works. The church secretly loves it when ex-mormons go ape-crazy and bad mouth the church. You're playing right into the plan. They expect you to do that, and they're not disappointed.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I would love to see is a calm, educational approach, devoid of ridicule and scorn. Be more scholarly and less guerrilla-like. Show them you actually care about them as people. newlinechar  newlinechar But of course, if you really don't care about them and you really are just wanting to throw shit, then don't expect people like me to be on your side.

You aren't spreading your own ideas by destroying Bibles. Honestly, the only message I get from you destroying Bibles is that you're too afraid of the words within, to let them exist. The central idea of freedom of speech is no idea is so dangerous that it shouldn't be allowed to exist. Destroying a book might be freedom of expression, but you're essentially engaged in your own personal censorship. If you really want to go down that path, there are a lot more Christians with a lot more resources than Atheists. If an Atheist movement went to the trouble to get copies of the God Delusion in Hotel Rooms, and Christians decided to adopt your tactic, and censor you by destroying them, they'd win out. newlinechar  newlinechar You're really no different than a Christian who says 'Silence people I don't agree with!

My specific issue is this: how do you merge discussion threads?  Thinking it through, a number of questions occur to me that seem hard to answer. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, who gets to decide that two threads refer to the same topic?  After two threads are merged, wouldn't it be confusing to users to read comments that refer to the first thread, when the user expectes to see comments referring specifically to the second thread?  Would both of the original posts that spawned the threads before the merge be preserved, or would one be eliminated?  If both are preserved, how are they presented to the readers of the conversation thread?  And what happens if two different threads get merged that shouldn't be merged?  When treads get split, which comments go with which thread?   newlinechar  newlinechar And what is wrong with having different discussions over the same issues?  For instance, in reddit, double-posts are frequent, and each post retains its own discussion thread; is this problematic, in your view?  If it proves very difficult to implement this idea without the solution being complicated, is this feature so important that a complicated solution be accepted? newlinechar

Jewish people tipped vary well, you could tell they were jewish because they have this metal thing that they nail on their doorframe.

I'm not going to pretend that you know that the US dollar is the *de facto* world currency anymore, because you've clearly demonstrated you do not understand this basic fact of international finance. Nearly all countries hold or use dollars, even countries like North Korea that the US does not like, because it is the most useful money in use in 2010. newlinechar  newlinechar The only bank accounts the Fed can control are bank accounts in the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar The reason why it's beyond you that US dollars people hold are their property is again because you lack the fundamental financial and accounting knowledge to be allowed outside /r/politics without an escort.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just look at what happens when a person puts money in a bank: the bank creates an asset (cash) and a liability (the deposit). The reason why it's a liability is because the money is not the bank's property; the bank has a duty to repay you back in dollars.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only way the Federal Reserve (or any other organization) could take money away from you without your consent is to deprive you of your right to that money. They have violated your property rights.  newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind, money existed before governments because people desire having a fungible, divisible, transportable medium of exchange. The reason why governments issue money (and then central banks usurp that power) is because with the monopoly power over the money supply, they have control over the actions of people. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;that 'something' happen to belong to the parent. newlinechar  newlinechar If the 1st parent doesn't know what the thing is they are looking for in the 2nd parent's house, how can they pretend to own it?

People would get far more out of a good history or art book written by scholars who may *reference* the 'Bible' (a story or 2 perhaps at the most). newlinechar  newlinechar Any deep, nuanced understanding (if that's possible on the subject) is the bullshit of scholars and is not really all that helpful. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It would be like trying to understand English literature without Shakespeare or contemporary biology without On the Origin of Species. newlinechar  newlinechar The same goes here. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be a loss if no one knew the history by which the theory of evolution was constructed, but who really cares... that's just small stuff. newlinechar  newlinechar Who really cares if Shakespeare coined some oft-used English phrases. It's interesting, but doesn't really matter. Literature is only really important to its contemporary audience; beyond that, it's just the bullshit of scholars. Shakespeare is of pretty much no use today (I say that with a straight face).

I was impressed by Topher's character specifically because I was original pretty underwhelmed by him when the show started.  I thought he was going to be just a sort of funny, 'look at how quirky and cool the young scientist is' kind of side show.  But his character really grew on me, especially as we got to know more about him.  He ended up being one of the most interesting characters, because you saw him go from a happy-go-lucky guy just interested in science, to suddenly developing some serious misgivings when he realizes the end-game at play.  In episode 13, i was at first put off by how he 'went crazy', thinking this was pretty silly.  But again the idea grew on me.. the way he didn't really think about the consequences of his actions until it slapped him in the face, it becomes a believable idea that he could completely lose the ability to deal with anything outside his own head... he was socially awkward to begin with.  I was sad that he died.. I didn't think that he really needed to be the one to set off the device, or that they couldn't rig up a wireless trigger.  But it makes sense that they didn't want to delay the event longer than necessary.  I think they could have saved him though, and kind of wish they had.

Well, I can do a factor analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar Two common factors were identified. The first encompasses IQ, Poverty, Murder, Theft and Religiousness, all of which were highly intercorrelated. The second factor was Generosity and Divorce, which were not correlated with the other measures. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar When I remove Divorce and Generosity from the analysis, IQ is the largest single factor (i.e. IQ has the highest correlation and predictive value over all of the other variables). The loading factor for IQ was 0.87 overall. Poverty had the second highest loading at 0.75, and all of the other loadings were medium strength (~0.6) except for conservatism and divorce (~0.4). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's important to note that this doesn't mean IQ causes the others. It accounts for the most variance in the other scores and lower IQ is probably a large predisposition to engage in criminal activity and religion, but since all of the factors were highly intercorrelated there's probably a strong interaction (That is, environments where murder, poverty and theft are more common also lead to lower standardized test scores).

&gt; Let's take one for an example. Welfare (in all its forms, and there are many). It creates a hurdle to overcome because of how it's always implemented. If you make below a certain amount, you get state assistance. If you make above a certain amount, you get nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't comment about American welfare systems, but in Australia at least some of the welfare systems scale with income. Two I'm aware of are the rent payable on government provided housing and student welfare received while undergoing tertiary education. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that many forms of welfare are, as you describe, implemented as *all or nothing* and that this is not helping, and contributes to wage slavery, but I don't think such welfare systems *have* to be this way. Welfare in *many* of its forms is as you describe, but certainly not *all*; it's not *always* implemented in this way (and should not be). newlinechar  newlinechar The responsible way to implement welfare is to ensure that an individual or family's income (including welfare) is monotonically increasing as a function of their wages. This requires all welfare payments to be scaled to income, with the reduction of welfare being less than the increase in income. newlinechar  newlinechar This makes the welfare system *genuinely* in the interest of the welfare recipients, not a system of enslaving them in a welfare 'potential well'.

&gt;First, slavery was an integral part of the American economy during the slave trade. I’ve read some papers that go so far as to say the American economy was built off of the slave trade. It appears the American version of history is a little different then the version they teach in Canada. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course slavery was an big part of our agriculture.  But what do you think happened to poor white farmers when free labor was available to the rich?  Do you think that small/mid-sized family farms could compete with the wealthy?  Or do you have the mistaken belief that all southerners owned slaves? newlinechar  newlinechar Slavery did not exist inside of a bubble, it had many repercussions on the poor whites (especially Southern).  They were not able to compete with the big farms, leaving wealth to accumulate with a select few and they were not able to find high paying jobs. newlinechar  newlinechar Look up Appalachian poverty if you don't believe me.  The southern white person is amongst the poorest in our country. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My point is that there are far less poor white people then poor African Americans newlinechar  newlinechar No, there are more poor white people than poor African Americans.  Black people make up a small portion of our population (around 15% I believe), so statistically, there will be less poor black people than poor white people.  But they (within their own community) have a higher percentage of poor than white people do. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I have also witnessed some disgusting, racist acts that 'Billy Bob' doesn't have to worry about.

The starting up of negotiations is pretty tricky, and subtle, with a long history of failure on *both* sides. newlinechar  newlinechar You're indeed correct - Abbas has set a pre-condition: stop building and expanding the fucking settlements.

First thought: I hope Mr. Theroux and his crew had access to a therapist after this. newlinechar  newlinechar We've all seen how this group pickets funerals and protests cultural events, but this documentary is great because it shows how embedded this way of thinking is in their lives. They literally think about nothing else. The most telling bit was near the end of that first part where a young man answers the question of whether or not the picket was successful with, 'Yeah. God did this, so it's perfect.' newlinechar  newlinechar This group lives, breathes, eats and shits this stuff. It's not hard to understand that they truly believe it when you realize that they've been indoctrinated from the minute they were born. newlinechar  newlinechar One has to think though, in a group of about one hundred or so, *at least* one or two has to question the merit of the message they are trying to spread.

&gt;What type of prison were you a guard in? Is this a high security prison? Or all low security where the prisoners can literally just walk 'off campus' and that's considered an escape? newlinechar  newlinechar We had deathrow, Administrative segregation (the bad ones), medium custody, minimum custody and trustees. My unit housed 2800 inmates.  Deathrow and ad seg were suppose to be hard to escape from but both escapes I stopped were deathrow inmates. The trustee camp was really a separate campus from the main unit.  newlinechar  newlinechar  &gt;but did you hear of any others that were really good escape plots? newlinechar  newlinechar Not at my unit but there are 7 units in huntsville and there were a couple of ingenious escapes.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How difficult would it be to escape, if that was the prisoner's goal? newlinechar  newlinechar If you were in a high security area, difficulty = very hard. First you have to find a way off your cell block (deathrow/ad seg only leave the cell block in handcuffs, leg irons and with two escorts), Then you have to make it out of the main building, then you have to make it out of the fences, then you have to make it off the prison property (my unit was 12000 acres). if you were a trustee you could pretty much walk off, but trustees don't do that very often because trustees have 5 years or less on their sentence and the penalty for escape is 20 years.

I'm 100% positive that Paul would oppose such a thing as legalized slavery anywhere. Constitutional federalism, as advocated by Paul, places certain limited restrictions on States as requirements for admission to the Union. In addition, anywhere that had slavery would not be libertarian. Libertarianism is the fight *against* slavery. Libertarians might generally oppose attacking a nation that did have slavery, but mostly on the grounds of collateral damage and problems with taxation and war finance. Most libertarians wouldn't have a problem with a slave or a bystander using violence against a slaveowner. newlinechar  newlinechar For true libertarians, State's rights is usually seen as a better means to accomplish the libertarian ends. For example, slavery in 10 states would not be as bad as slavery in the entire country. Libertarians would all say it sucks, but is still less bad. State's rights, by themselves, have absolutely nothing to do with libertarianism though. It's quite unfortunate that people have misinterpreted libertarianism from various sources and actually latched on to those things. Ron Paul is a libertarian, but he advocates Constitutionalism/State's rights as a means. People have mistaken this as him only caring about the Constitution. I'm an anarchist though so most of this discussion is unrelated to me, but it is very relevant to minarchists.

(The reason for using just the last 5 is that we were only able to see the last 5 digits when we pulled up their information.

&gt;Xbox outputs a much lower res (Halo 3 was only 640p) and I'm not sure about PS3. newlinechar  newlinechar Both the Xbox 360 and PS3 are fully capable of outputting video at 1920×1080 progressive, also known as 1080p. The reason Halo 3 displays at a resolution of 1138x640 is because that's the limit that this game's developers put on this specific game to ensure a pre-designed level of graphical fidelity. newlinechar  newlinechar Many Xbox 360 and PS3 games display at different resolutions than their respective system's maximum limit, usually to ensure a steady frame rate for their specific graphical engine. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;PC puts out a higher res newlinechar  newlinechar This is a nonsensical statement. A given systems's maximum output resolution is not based on whether or not it's a 'PC' but on the specific capabilities of the individual graphics cards they use, and the display's maximum physical resolution. For example, there are many monitors sold today that are unable to display anything above 1600x900 (which is below the so-called 1080p resolution). Likewise, there are many PCs sold today that may theoretically be programmed to display something at very high resolutions, but are incapable of running the specific games (like Bad Company 2) at those resolutions.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would estimate that at least 75% of all computer models (desktops and notebooks) sold at any given national electronics store would provide inferior graphics capabilities to an Xbox 360 or a PS3. That's staggering, given that these game consoles are 5 years old.

I've only played the N64 version, but it had much more of a living, breathing town. You had an instanced farm plot, and townsfolk would stop by to ask how you are, give presents, invite you to a festival, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar The sandbox aspect came out when you could decide how you would make a profit (crops, livestock, winning prizes at festivals, etc.). By making everyday decisions, you could develop meaningful relationships with other characters, and eventually learn more about them. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, you had the same sense of anticipation and curiosity that you often to in the real world. You could tend your farm, go into town for a drink, stop by a friend's house, and call it a day (because you knew the Summer Festival was the next day, and there would be activities at the beach). newlinechar  newlinechar I know these things were in Animal Crossing, but Harvest Moon was a human world, in which each new day had a unique combination of possibilities.

&gt;was there ever a time when something happened that made you genuinely scared newlinechar  newlinechar So many I can't count. A couple stand out though. I was working the showers one day (we stood in the hall and coordinated with the housing units to release inmates for showers, and made sure only the inmates scheduled to shower used the shower) and this inmate who wanted to shower approached me while I was at the shower door. This inmate should have showered earlier and I told him to leave. He backed me into the shower ( he was much larger than me) like he was going to beat the shit out of me, but I just stood up to him cussed him out, and sent him on his way. This could have been really bad in that he could have kicked my ass and no one would have known for at least 30 min. I was always scared working the gym and chow hall because of the inmate to officer ratio (300-400:1). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;the prisoners were able to tell that you are scared? newlinechar  newlinechar No. Absolutely not.

Sure. My experience is only in Maine. - But, it can be easy (especially at night) to run over a lobster pot and get your propeller snagged in a buoy. -Or even a rudder or keel if you're in a sailboat. Often times it's possible to untangle, but sometimes it's not, so you pull a knife out, cut the buoy loose and go on your way. newlinechar  newlinechar But, that means a lobsterman is going to loose his lobster pot, and whatever lobsters were in it. It's very much frowned upon, like dinging a parked car and riding off. -And that's just when you're benevolent. If you're caught cutting a line, it can easily be assumed that you're poaching the lobsters. I was told once that this can carry fines of $10,000, and I was like 'what, how?'. Well, they figure that if you get caught once, there are 10 other times when you did it before. Not the best precedent, but lobstering is very important to the local economy, and the law looks after people's livelihoods.

I have lived in a lot of states in the US, and overall, most people are the same. They all have the same dreams, fears, desires, and needs pretty much. So where is the divergence in thought coming from? I just don't understand how balanced compassionate rational individuals could really think in this modern world we live in that gays are any LESS of a person than anyone else.

&gt; anything anyone does has some sentiment of selfishness. So to say suicide is selfish isn't different than saying wanting the person considering suicide to live through the pain ,agony that is their life is pretty selfish. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree, and for the record that is in effect what I was saying.    The complementary argument is not for the family and friends to intervene selfishly, but rather for them to *understand that the person was in pain* and wanted nothing more than to end their own life.  There will always be some residual anger when someone you love takes their own life.  The important thing to leave behind you is the knowledge that you were in your right mind and that you wanted to save yourself and them the pain of what you were going through or were about to go through.  Accepting that is always hard for those left behind.   But I feel strongly that suicide is a private matter.  If you lack the conviction to commit suicide, you probably shouldn't; it is far too easy to pawn it off on someone else, shifting the blame and acceptance off to them.   newlinechar  newlinechar NOTE:  I'm not saying that there aren't circumstances through paraplegia or a lack of living will that someone may wish but be physically unable to commit suicide. **But please do not confuse suicide with euthanasia.**

There's a great deal of work that's been done in order to make holocaust denial seem probable. One reason was the perceived impossibility of incinerators being capable of killing that many people in such a short time. To this day I'm still not sure about that point, but I haven't researched it and no longer care. There's also the matter of some Jewish almanac census reporting widely conflicting numbers about the Jewish populations before and after the holocaust happened. newlinechar  newlinechar As to the ends, I assumed it was exaggerated by the Jews in order to gain sympathy as a group, establish the state of Israel, and make money by selling the story. newlinechar  newlinechar These points run parallel with 9/11 conspiracy theories. You string together a handful of unrelated, unexplained facts or embellishments. It's obviously bullshit, but when you want it to be true you're willing to make that mental leap.  newlinechar  newlinechar I believed it for the same reason as they do. They hate George Bush so deeply that they WANT him to be responsible for 9/11. They WANT it to be true. At that point in my life Hitler espoused views that I shared and so I didn't want to believe that he could be such a monster, or that my beliefs could lead to something so horrible. There were, however, certain people in the movement who not only believed the holocaust was true but encouraged another one. These people were pretty much shunned, as the more sensible white supremacists realized this was obviously insane and instead chose to believe it never happened.

Wikipedia doubts you newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; A more probable theory is that it derives from the slang phrase 'All is bob,' meaning that everything is safe, pleasant or satisfactory.

There have been several other slang expressions containing bob, some associated with thievery or gambling, and from the eighteenth century on it was also a common generic name for somebody you didn’t know. Any or all of these might have contributed to its genesis.[2]

&gt;You aren't spreading your own ideas by destroying Bibles newlinechar  newlinechar Agreed.  But I contend that I *am* spreading my own ideas if I alter bibles and offer that product to the masses in order to make a statement (which is why I posted the original thread).  And again, I'm only altering books that are mine (assuming the Gideons make good on their word that I'm free to take them).  I would never advocate taking someone else's book, let alone taking it and destroying it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I would much rather have a Bible next to 'The God Delusion' in a drawer than no books at all and a bonfire in the front yard.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would much rather have nothing at all in a drawer and *no* bonfire in the front yard.  Why should there be bibles in hotel rooms in the first place?  I understand that hotel chains are private enterprises and that they're free to do what they want, but it's generally accepted that bibles should always be found in bedside drawers in hotel rooms.  Why?  People would make quite a fuss if bibles weren't there, or, alternately if there *were* copies of *The God Delusion* and the bible in their room, like you suggested.  Can you imagine the reaction if a Marriott only placed copies of the Koran in their rooms?  The truth is, major corporations probably shouldn't endorse any belief system, and if they do, they should be prepared for any backlash.  The fact that hotels don't claim those bibles as their property is testament to their desire to distance themselves from the issue.  If they were running a library, they would be much more concerned with keeping track of their books and ensuring their return.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're really no different than a Christian who says 'Silence people I don't agree with!...' newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree, and I believe there's a fundamental difference.  I am *not* advocating the destruction of the bible or the Christian message.  I am, however, advocating that people treat it no differently than any other information they receive.  I don't expect to find copies of Newton's *Pricipia* in hotels, despite the fact that people could benefit from reading it and that much of it is in line with my ideas.  And I don't think people should be prevented from doing what they want with their own copies of *Pricipia* as long as those copies aren't of historical significance.
I'm not sure if we're saying the same thing or not. I'm saying 'it doesn't have to be stored well enough that it can be restarted.

I had a theatre teacher who was amazing, just slightly uptight about how you should follow school policy, whether you agree or not, but she was an amazing teacher. And the classes hated her, except for the drama/improv club, and the advanced theatre class.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They would constantly make her cry day in, and day out. She couldn't control them, because they just wouldn't pay attention, even when she tried to be strict.  newlinechar  newlinechar The last day of school she was in tears, and all the students were cursing her out, and telling her they're glad she was leaving. She left the district. When she did, the theatre, theatre club, one act play, and improv club all simultaneously died.  newlinechar  newlinechar The teacher that took over neither cared to really do them, nor did she attempt.  newlinechar  newlinechar The previous teacher had organized tons of plays and a musical, the one act play, and a talent show and an improv show, and a trip to a renaissance fair that year. And she was chased out of the school, because she had ungrateful students who either were forced to take her speech class, or had to take her standard theatre class for an arts credit, didn't like it, and therefore took it out on her.  newlinechar  newlinechar Our entire school went this way for the 3 years I remained at that school. Good teachers would say 'I'm not dealing with this' and leave, and we'd get new, less-than-adequate teachers who only got the job because the good ones with a few shortcomings left. newlinechar  newlinechar My point here is, while some teachers are assholes, or can't handle their classes perfectly, you shouldn't be rude to them. Alot of what you see really is more of you and your fellow students and the teachers combined, butting heads, rather than just the teachers. newlinechar  newlinechar When you get out of school, you realize a lot of them weren't as shitty as they seemed. Try to treat them better and pay attention. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, what you said just annoyed me.

I have stumbled upon one free and open source CAD project, [Wildcat-CAD.](http://code.google.com/p/wildcat-cad/) I believe that they are in the early stages of development. The software may not be fully usable, but at least it is in a step towards the right direction. newlinechar  newlinechar We have had some small discussions about FOSS CAD in the past. BRL-CAD was attempted, but came to the conclusion that it wouldn't help us as much as users that had access to proprietary CAD software already. At the moment, Google SketchUp has been really helpful, as far as concept rendering goes, although, I am not so sure how open source it is, but at least it is free. newlinechar  newlinechar

And if you cloak and decloak in less than the time of a single target from a battleship (which could easily be 15 seconds for some types of rats), they will still be targeting you from the previous round and lock you essentially instantly, ie, being cloaked doesn't interrupt lock in progress, it just cancels a lock that lands while you are cloaked. newlinechar  newlinechar Incidentally, this is true for PVP as well, so be careful.

&gt; Nothing favors wealth, not work, more neatly than the tax break on capital gains. President Clinton lowered the tax on long-term gains to 20 percent. President Bush cut it again, to 15 percent, little more than half the rate paid by middle-class Americans on their wages. Bush's action pushed the rate to a 70-year low; it's now at 77 years and counting, going back to 1933. newlinechar  newlinechar Middle class people must not own stocks or bonds I guess.  newlinechar  newlinechar Low capital gains tax favors capital accumulation leading to expansion of the capital stock, more capital per worker, and therefore more output per worker. Author disregards the fact that both capital and labor are components of a production function and we have to assign some value to the use of capital just as we assign value to labor through wages.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Only a trace amount of all the churning on Wall Street grows anything. Small companies with big dreams raise seed money through initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary offerings. These investments deserve a bigger tax break than they get now; there's a strong case for making them tax-free. All other stock market gains should be taxed the same as wages (which they were, back when). newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that there are IPOs, secondary offerings, and repeated debt offerings are contingent on an actual secondary market existing for the stuff. You dry up demand on the secondary market through hiking capital gains tax and you can expect that its going to have a negative effect on the health of the primary market.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is an aside from the fact that there is considerable risk putting your own money up to own shares of a given stock or purchase a bond. There seems to be a perception that these assets only appreciate when they don't (often for years at a time or never).  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Tax breaks on Wall Street gains (except as noted) fail three fiscal policy tests. They serve no purpose. They're a limitless drain on the Treasury. And they're inequitable: they favor wealth, not work. Income is income, and should be taxed the same no matter where it comes from. newlinechar  newlinechar I can agree that tax breaks on wall street serve no purpose in the long run. However, the notion that a low capital gains tax is implicitly a 'break' for wall street is an utter joke. Capital gains taxes are going to affect most people with an actual rate of savings, and more broadly, the future job market.

To paraphrase **flossdaily** in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aprrn/reddit_tell_me_about_the_absolute_hands_down/c0jpvlr), he knows the answer to a mystery before introducing the mystery. newlinechar  newlinechar The flight details were unrealistic. On smaller corporate jets, the flight crew, being the only crew, are much more involved with the passengers. You get to know them well, so instead of 'the plane landed', your friends and fellow travelers landed the plane. And, long before the landing, the pilots would be aware of the unusual silence from air traffic controllers, and other planes. Surely they would mention this to the passengers. newlinechar  newlinechar Zombies usually have no place in science fiction. They are characters from  fantasy and horror stories.

&gt; since economics deals mainly with the workings of self-aware beings, rather than the concrete and steel that one would use to build a bridge, the applications for math are limited. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose this is a philosophical issue, but I think human behaviour obeys the laws of cause-and-effect just like anything else.

I think we mostly agree on this - but I'll say I agree that 3x MD5 is no safer than 53xMD5.  The only 'safety' you get from it is that the attacker doesn't know whether you did 3 or 53.  The act of re-hashing itself isn't getting you anywhere.  I'm certainly not advocating using lots of MD5s or some obscure pattern in PLACE of a salt, but I think that tiny bit of obscurity is pretty easy to do, so I don't see why you wouldn't *shrug*.

I wasn't really talking about just collisions - but since you mentioned it - Wouldn't collisions almost make it MORE secure in this case?  Say you store just MD5(SHA(pass)).  You know it's MD5, fine.  They do an MD5 table and there are 2 or even 3 strings that equate to that MD5.  Now they have to do a SHA table on each of those strings to find the original pass. newlinechar  newlinechar If you continue that logic out to something like MD5^1000(SHA(pass)) you could end up with quite a pain in the ass for someone to reverse that. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, unless I'm totally thinking about this the wrong way.
mmaping a file really isn't any different that allocating a big-ass array in virtual memory, and there is a whole category of so-called 'cache oblivious' algorithms that are both elegant and have good scaling behavior once you move beyond physical memory. (Although I don't know if sparse matrix multiplication falls into that category. Probably scales better using message passing in a cluster, rather than an out-of-core streaming-from-disk solution.) newlinechar  newlinechar For example, here's one for computing an approximate k-nearest-neighbor graph that uses a morton/z-order layout to achieve good locality. http://sites.google.com/a/compgeom.com/stann/ In the related paper http://compgeom.com/%7Epiyush/papers/tvcg_stann.pdf they claim good performance in just such a scenario where you simply allocate an array that is bigger than your physical memory and let the OS deal with mmapping.

This guy needs to stop collecting flower paintings (his overly neat apartment, decorated with feminine touches screams that he's nesting) and learn to be a man.

A guy who can't handle dealing with real women, and chooses inaccessible women that don't break his idealized view of what women really are. I feel sad, sad for this self-confessed 'impotent' man.

Looking at the article posted by nicasucio ([Game Brain](http://www.gq.com/sports/profiles/200909/nfl-players-brain-dementia-study-memory-concussions)) and particularly the quotes I posted from it (see above) I think that the problems are unique to American football. Rugby players don't deliberately bang heads. They tackle with their heads low to protect them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I'm not a player. Do you get a lot of head bangs during matches? What position do you play? Initially I thought the risk would be greater for forwards as they are doing the bulk of the tackling, but those impacts are quite low speed. It is the backs who endure high speed collisions which might cause the brain to jiggle about in the skull. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A campaigner in the article (who was a football player and then a wrestler who retired through ill health) has his head injuries described: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Those were concussions. All those times. Not just the times he had become unconscious. But all those times, perhaps one hundred times, that he saw stars, suffered a “ding”—any loss of brain function induced by trauma was a concussion, and all of them were serious, all of them were brain injuries, all of them required attention, not the least of which was the time to heal before suffering another one. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Does this sound familiar to you or to your team mates?

If UBS falls over this, no other bank is every going to transfer illegal money out of the US again.  It won't be worth it.  And that is why the US needs to let UBS fall.

UBS basically offered the service to get money out and advertised it to rich people.  Supposedly UBS employees even carried money personally in suitcases back to switzerland.

It's so hard when assessing sarcasm and the like with respect to statements about Jobs and apple...  there is such a weird aura around such discussions that it's so hard for me to tell.  Fanboys who come out and say that everything Apple does is revolutionary and seem to mean it... when if that sort of thing was uttered in any other context the appropriate thing to do would be to assume parody or sarcasm because no one would be that religious about a corporate product.  But that rule doesn't apply in apple discusions and it bugs the shit out of me. newlinechar  newlinechar My complaint is not that Jobs has a reality distortion field.  Maybe his products really are that great.

Resillience is used to counter critical damage.  Higher resillience equals less chance of being hit with a critical strike. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Mobs that someone would find in a raid (A PvE, or Player vs. Environment) setting do not have high critical strike chances.  They typicall crit infrequently, and, ideally, a priest shouldn't be getting hit in the first place.  This makes resillience a less viable stat for PvE. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The only enemies that typically have high critical strike odds are player characters, which is why resillience is only really found in gear suited for PvP (player vs. player) combat.

A brigadier general is typically someone who served 15+ years. Military justice system requires that the judge is at least one rank above the accused; it follows that we are not talking about disciplinary justice (דין משמעתי) but a court marshal in a military court (בית דין צבאי). Since the charges described as excession of authority and endangerment of life, I would estimate that the punishment is suspended half a year in prison and/or demotion (which, for senior officers, is devastating). newlinechar  newlinechar

Believe me, sextants are still in use. Here in the UK, port towns usually have classes available in stellar navigation and the use of the sextant, and all the marine chandlers I use still sell them, including cheap training ones for kids. newlinechar  newlinechar Back in the early '70s when I was in the Navy, they were using Loran, mostly. When they used a sextant, they generally used the quartermaster's Omega watch because it was more accurate than either of the ship's two chronometers. newlinechar  newlinechar However, we still had to have the two chronometers, and the quartermasters had to make sure they were kept wound up. There'd have been big trouble, and a number of people including all the quartermastes would have been up on charges more serious than leaking Hurley’s death in the upcoming season if either of them stopped because it ran down.

There are 52 cards in a deck.. therefore.. there are 52! combinations of different decks. newlinechar  newlinechar 1/(52!) is the probability of a single deck being one of those individual combinations. newlinechar  newlinechar For it to happen twice.. it would be 1/(52!)^2 using the product rule of probabilities.  That is roughly equivalent to 1/6505741221906667575245316997473186469866905063226208557343998931559480700154550540918463145870938904834370174976000000000000000000000000 newlinechar  newlinechar So yes, it is HIGHLY likely any given deck is unique given a sufficient amount of shuffling.

Ahem. The internet is an interesting place. Whilst the anonymity of it has increased, and the access to knowledge, and services has increased, I still think it is not much more different from our society. Since society is made from people, and people are what drive the internet, it's relatively the same. However, the anonymity allows us to live 'double-lives' or slip away in a fantasy world, and also allows us to hide things. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, with a mild understanding of psychology and human nature, I can understand how someone can have an 'e-motional' affair via the internets, and somehow separate it from their real life. The truth is, it's ultimately not. There is actually a real person on the other end that you are interacting with. You are an actual person. You are actually cheating on your partner. I can completely understand the consequences of committing infidelity through technology, but I cannot understand why people blame the internet for allowing such a thing to happen. Of course, it's been initiated and carried out over the internet, but what is the likelihood of the guilty to do such a thing in real life? Internet or not, it's cheating in my eyes. Anyone in a healthy relationship would feel bad about this, would they not? Personally, if I found myself seeking gratification from someone over the internet, while in a relationship, I would start second guessing my current relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar I met my current partner over the internet. I was technically in a relationship with someone at the time. However, we were 'on a break' as much as you can be while living together, and it had already been established that we weren't feeling much love, but neither of us had anywhere else to go at the time. The fact that I started to have feelings for my current partner at the time of meeting, only confirmed that my current relationship was definitely falling apart. I'm not going to go into detail about how I managed things, but I will tell you, that I did my best to keep things 'at arms length' until ties with my ex had been severed, to make it fair for all parties. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, I've gone a bit off track. Blaming the internet for having an affair, is *wrong*. Did they blame telephones, or mail for having an affair? Or what about long-distance travel and global business taking people away on business? We live in a different time, and our world is changing. Pointing fingers and blaming anything but ourselves for our mistakes and downfalls is wrong, and immature. newlinechar

Well, like what? newlinechar  newlinechar We all have the problem of protecting our feet from the elements outside. What's the solution? Shoes. The government didn't need to fix this for us; the free market did. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a more potent example, consider racism. The libertarian will deem it quite okay for a shop owner to prohibit customers of a certain race from entering his store. The idea is that this won't last long, because the shop owner puts himself at an immediate disadvantage to the shop owner who doesn't so brazenly discriminate. (But, we recognize the shop owner's *right* to do it.)
In my experience, yeah, meth isn't much of an issue in the northeast.
I'm thinking about writing more books. No plans at the moment for another Lisp book, though. What were you thinking of?
neither do I.  If you eliminate government than you eliminate war.  You also eliminate the cost of the war, leaving more money in the pockets of individuals.  The individuals could use that money to start a business and employ people, possibly poor people, or could give it to a charity which is more efficient and effective at dealing with poverty.  You also eliminate the billions that go to presidential campaigns.  That money could be donated to something more productive.  Even if that money goes to buy something to satisfy some greedy person, that something was made by someone, who received a paycheck.  So even in this case we all win.

Even if you assume the Bibles are okay for you to take, you're still practicing censorship because you are motivated whether you admit it or not to prevent someone from reading the Bible. You're targeting Bibles specifically because you don't like the information inside. You could easily just take free travel brochures and alter them to convey your ideas, burn in your fireplace for warmth, or find some other book to alter and convey your ideas. And you've already collected a stack, and declared it will grow, even though you likely have way more than you'll ever end up doing anything with. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not against altering books for some other purpose. The Library at my College used to give away old books, and I made a hollow book out of one. But you are targeting Bibles. What I'm against is destroying, or at the very least, depriving others of books because you don't agree with the content. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't say I don't wish that corporations and businesses wouldn't adopt political or religious agendas I don't agree with, but if I were a business owner, I wouldn't want to have my freedom of speech infringed upon if I wanted to put an Atheist book in my hotel, or an Atheist brochure in the lobby. Nor would I want someone taking copies simply because they don't agree with them. The reason we have Bibles in Hotel rooms, is that every citizen has the right to free speech, even business owners and they have the right to put them in their hotels. newlinechar  newlinechar I used to be a scary conservative Christian myself, and my former self would likely have agreed with you that the book is just paper, but I would have asserted the information inside is still true, not matter what you do to it. You are convincing no one that the information in the Bible isn't true by destroying copies of it. And you are unlikely to convince me you don't advocate the destruction of Bibles when you do it yourself, and come to an atheist forum to ask for ideas with what do with all the ones you've taken from hotel rooms, depriving others of them.

Yes, it is. There are no drugs in there other than alcohol. Anything else is purely for flavour and/or colour. Even if there ever was enough thujone used in its production to give any sort of noticeable effect, there certainly isn't now because of various regulations. Ignorant people drink it neat, become heavily drunk, and then jump to the conclusion that it must have been some other substance rather than the fact that they simply drank too much. Read your own damn link: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Although absinthe was vilified, no evidence has shown it to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Its psychoactive properties, apart from those of alcohol, have been **much exaggerated**. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;More recently, published scientific analyses of samples of various original absinthes have disproven earlier estimates, showing that **very little of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe** when using historical recipes and methods. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Thujone, the active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist; and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, **there is no evidence that it causes hallucinations**. newlinechar  newlinechar Now don't get me wrong, absinthe is one of my favourite alcoholic drinks, especially when prepared in the traditional method, but it is just alcohol.

It took me a long time to get my head around this aspect of classical mythology.  If there were two or more conflicting versions of a myth I'd try and figure out which was the 'right' one - as if there was a pure source you could trace the story back to if you looked widely enough.  But these stories were constantly evolving...as Greek culture expanded foreign gods were often renamed and worked into the existing fabric of the myth, like you say. Once you realise you have to be able to hold two opposing ideas in your head at the same time, interpreting and enjoying the batshit insane wtf-ery of classical myth is so much easier.  It also puts to bed the kind of 'Heracles/Hercules' pedantry people like to indulge in -- the people who first told the story wouldn't even ascribe most of the legends to the name. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Dionysus, he was apparently a late import from Asia  so there are a lot of different versions; I just threw together what I could remember from The Bacchae. :p Glad to see another fan of the Hellenic, I enjoyed reading your comments.

Thanks for the AMA. Giving preferential treatment to women is very common in mixed gender establishments. For example bars and saunas, which try in various ways to keep out or limit unpaired men, or charge them much higher entry fees. Personally I disagree with it, but then I'm neither a woman, nor someone attracted to women, so I get no benefit from the reduced hassle or the higher cunt to dick ratio. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to point out that what is really disciminatory is the claim that keeping out single men is for the *safety* of others. Being hooked up with a woman does not make a man safe, and unattached males are not by definition creepy dangerous people.

She does say there's big ones and small ones. Could it be possible that the small ones are just aftershocks?

This is true for any hash.  If you have a n-bit hash, there are 2^n (exponent) possible hash outputs given any possible starting plaintext.  However, after the first hash, this means there are only 2^n inputs for the next iteration.  It's very unlikely that each hash output, when hashed again yields a unique value.  So, the search space is reduced to something less than 2^n.  And so on.
That is a very timely point of view, and that's not what I'm talking about at all.  Seriously, think about religion now, 20 years ago, 50 years ago, 500 years ago and 1000 years ago.  Do you notice a trend?   You should.

If they've got a single hash, and the salt made them unable to precalculate anything, that's a win right there. But whether or not they know the salt, brute forcing will take the same amount of time. So the salt makes them use the _worst_ attack algorithm possible, and knowledge of it doesn't improve their odds even in that case.  newlinechar  newlinechar But that's not what's truly great about salts. Say they compromised your entire account database. And instead of trying to crack a single admin account, they're just wanting to break _any_ account. Assuming you generate a different salt for every password hash... they have to re-perform brute force attacks on each entry, they can't parallelize their attack even on the accounts w/in the database; whereas if salts are reused, ever, that makes 2 accounts with a matching salt twice as efficient to brute force. newlinechar  newlinechar Salts are not a secret that has to be protected. Salts are a hedge against homogeny to prevent precalculation, and that it all.

I'm sorry, but the belief that improving general [and infant!] mortality rates will somehow lower birth rates is naive and absurd. You go on to illustrate your failure to grasp the economic problem. Improving the economy (which will lead to a stronger and more unified government) will require *less* aid. The more free food and goods that are given to each country, the more the local industry suffers; after all, who can compete with free? newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is extremely complex, but what sanrabb said is essentially true. We must view foreign aid as a finite resource that won't be available forever. When we view countries where aid is being distributed, a common occurrence is an *increase* in birth rate. Naturally, uneducated populations with limited access to birth control will reproduce until their food supply runs out. The option is to either educate the population *intensively* and *all at once*, as well as supply them with unlimited options for birth control; or cut off the aid which is actually devastating to both reproduction rates and their local economy. I view the former as unrealistic. Cultural practises like having large families die hard, and I don't feel any amount of education will change that. This is why I firmly believe that in order to save more lives in the future, some must be lost now.

Do tell.
I think this only holds in cases where you have nested theories. Generally speaking an exact theory can be more probable than an inexact one there's more evidence for it. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, let's say you have a 6-sided die. Consider the following statements: newlinechar  newlinechar Statement x: 'You will roll either 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.' newlinechar  newlinechar Statement y 'You will roll a 3.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Statement z 'You will roll either a 1,2,3,4,5,or 6.' newlinechar  newlinechar Statement x is less exact than y; both x and y are less exact than z. Likewise for content (Assuming that content is proportional to exactness). newlinechar  newlinechar But what about the probability of the statements? Given that this is a 6 sided die, there are 6 logical possible outcomes. Based on this, newlinechar  newlinechar     p(x) = 5/6, newlinechar     p(y) = 1/6 newlinechar     p(z) = 6/6 = 1 newlinechar  newlinechar This assumes that the die is fair. Without additional information about the die, this seems like a reasonable assumption. But let's say we do have additional information about the die: You roll the die 99 times, and every single time it comes up 3. Given this new information, what are the probabilities of the statements for the 100th roll of the die? newlinechar  newlinechar One option is to abandon the assumption that the die is fair, accept the possibility that the die is weighted, and adjust probabilities accordingly. But if allow this, it is possible that a more exact statement (y) can be more probable than a less exact statement (x) if the die is weighted enough towards one outcome. newlinechar  newlinechar The other option is to bite the bullet and maintain that the probabilities are the same as before, regardless of the experimental evidence. But this seems to be a misunderstanding of probability - essentially you are saying that the probability of rolling any specific number is 1/6 *even if the the die is weighted*. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that your conception of probability is close to the 2nd option. You seem to consider the probability of a statement to be something like 'the fraction of all logically possible states-of-affairs that are consistent with this statement'. I want to say probability doesn't work that way: there may be 6 logical possible outcomes for a 6-sided die but if the die is weighted the probabilities of a particular outcome won't be 1/6. newlinechar 
Ok people stop down-voting me. These are the facts. People who rush back into a burning building, I don't care if it's your mother you want to save, you are endangering lives. You go into the building to save someone and end up passed out from the smoke or worse and now firefighters have two people to save instead of one. By going back into the house she wasn't just endangering her own life for a *dog* (if you really love your pet that much there's something wrong with you) she was endangering the lives of the firefighters. I don't care how emotional you are that's a really stupid thing to do.

My personal guess is that he still would have lost the race --Amundsen was a baddass too and unequivocally had more knowledge and technique and discipline than anything the British, even Shacky, could offer-- but that unlike Scott, he wouldn't have gotten himself and his comrades killed in the process.   newlinechar  newlinechar What worsens the offense on the part of the British is that there is a great deal of evidence to the effect that Shackleton was denied command of the polar expedition because he was Irish and not because he wasn't clearly more qualified than Scott, which he was, and which everyone who knew anything about polar exploration at the time knew very well.

Thanks for the link to the article. Very interesting. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar My insticts about helmets seem to be backed up by this quote from Julian Bailes, a neurosurgeon, on p6 of the article. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“Helmets are not the answer. The brain has a certain amount of play inside the skull. It’s buoyed up in the cerebral spinal fluid. It sits in this fluid, floats. When the head suddenly stops, the brain continues, reverberates back. So when I hit, boom, my skull stops, but my brain continues forward for about a centimeter. Boom, boom, it reverberates back. So you could have padding that’s a foot thick. It’s not going to change the acceleration/deceleration phenomenon. And a lot of these injuries are rotational. The fibers get torn with rotation. You’ve got a face mask that’s like a fulcrum sitting out here: You get hit, your head swings around. That’s when a lot of these fibers are sheared—by rotation. A helmet can’t ever prevent that. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“And have you seen helmets lately? In the old days of football, you had this leather cap to protect your ears. That was it. You’d never put your head in the game. You’d be knocked out after the first play! Even in the ’60s, the helmet was a light shell. The modern helmet is like a weapon.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Rugby head protectors are like old time football caps. They are just a small amount of foam (with lots of air gaps for heat control) which I think are mostly to prevent the forwards from getting cauliflower ears in the scrum. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Really, football is going to have to change. You can't have a sport (particularly one which children play) the playing of which necessitates long term brain injury leading leading to the early death of its participants. It is natural for people who love their sport to be suspicious of arguments that their sport causes harm. But once the evidence is in, you can't continue to have people profit from this.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“So I told the NFL, I said, ‘Why don’t you take the head out of the game? Just take it out of the game! Let the linemen start from a squatting position instead of getting down for head-to-head. Have them stand up like they do on pass protection. So there’s not this obligatory head contact.’  newlinechar  newlinechar

The Avatar review IS boring. However, the strength of the reviews (in general) is in the over-the-top character and the expert analysis. He offered no real insight into Avatar, but used most of it as a vehicle to regurgitate his best remembered character bits, which is disappointing.

Sort of agree/sort of disagree.  I think ethical drug dealers simply want to provide substance to willing and educated constituents, and accrue a nominal overhead representative of the risk they take in making the supply available. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, a dealer could certainly become imbued with greed (not any different than a banker) and make choices that screw his or her customers in order to garner higher profit.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar dreamstretch and evrae above make a nice point of clarity: would we hold bartenders responsible for the problems of alcoholics?  We do, in fact (in the U.S., at least)!  Because alcohol is a legally traded substance, we are able to build in safeguards.  The bartender (or, for this example, let's say bar owner) has a financial stake in how much alcohol is consumed, but also has financial reprecusions for causing his or her patrons harm. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I do not know if the original OP was a responsible and ethical drug dealer, but the truth is he has come here to share his life, and not for us to make judgments against.

Oh to be an assassin again at the gates of Harrogath. newlinechar  newlinechar Let me expand on this: At some point in Diablo 2's release history the Bloody Foothills zone gave some of the best experience to level your character and it certainly gave the *easiest* experience since it was right outside of the starting village of Act V. newlinechar  newlinechar The assassin class could lay traps on the ground so you would put them down a little outside of the gates everyone would be coming through, hide and wait.  Or you'd open a town portal with traps around it and give the impression to late-comers that they could join right up with the party. newlinechar  newlinechar Even when this was all well known there'd still be enough people who would fall for it, who had a momentary lapse of reason or who underestimated the level of my assassin's lighting traps skill.  All-in-all victims enough. newlinechar  newlinechar The best part of course was that all this was done in hard-core mode meaning that when a character dies he is well and truly dead and his possessions are gone to the great bit-bucket in the sky.

But the CS classes do require group programming assignments at all levels of the program.

Either I scramble to learn all the material and do most of the work myself, or we both fail. newlinechar  newlinechar Part of the problem is the sheer number of students from the same country all living and going to school together here. I don't blame them for wanting to speak their native tongue to one another while here as it would be so easy and comforting to do so. However, because they are not forced to speak only/mostly English while at University they are not picking the language up as quickly as say an English person going to school in China.

They aren't necessarily 'against' your side, either, because that's a terrible construction of the debate. I see this to be a problem coming from equivocation over what philosophy refers to; a branch of academic criticism, fashionable social criticism, grad students posting on the internet, or whatever else. Somehow, someone got it in their head that the debate over science is a political struggle between scientists and 'anti-scientists' (creationist, or whoever). This is false, the debate over science is a *philosophical* one and has existed before the age of enlightenment.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, yes, I graduated with a degree in Philosophy but I'm an ardent neo-humean. The problem is that your average armchair scientist has no idea what that means and assume I'm anti-science whenever I criticize something that I think isn't scientific. 
The whole article is rather silly up until the last sentence. It is not 'rational' to play the nash equilibrium strategy unless you can iterate the rationality assumption 999,999 times.

The fact that game theoretic solutions are not always observed does not invalidate game theory. newlinechar  newlinechar The correct thing to do is to play the 'maximally exploitative' strategy. This means imposing a probability distribution on all the possible strategies played by your opponent(s) and then maximizing your expectation.

I worked at a place where we would have a lot of extra food to throw away at the end of the night, things like bagels and muffins.  We obviously weren't allowed to just give it to people on the street, but we had people who weren't homeless come ask us if they could pick up the food each night and take it to the homeless shelter.  We still weren't allowed to do that.  I think the reasoning was that the people could become dependant on it or something.

I wish I could say I felt bad about this, but WotC had printed every possible book I could ever want.  At this point, there was no real need for them to continue.

It's the mentality behind sensationalist garbage like this headline that makes me embarassed to call myself an atheist. To say that they kidnapped some kids to sell for $10,000 each implies clear intent and knowledge of what they were doing. There has been nothing to suggest this. On the contrary, the $10,000 claim was made by a policeman who didn't have all the facts, and was simply speculating on the issue. The kidnapping charge is less shaky, though I don't believe they had criminal intent, nor is their any evidence to suggest such an intent. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I would chalk this up to miscommunication and misunderstanding of Haitian law.

I think his reaction was absolutely ridiculous though. newlinechar  newlinechar I can understand being a disappointed in the school. If I were in that situation, I would probably have visited the school and had a quick word with them about making sweeping, disingenuous statements about a group of people, only because I wouldn't want my children to pick up the habit of grouping up some people and attributing them to negativity. I probably would have also strongly requested the teacher apologize to the students who heard her utterance, so as not to give them the idea that it's 'okay' to insult someone behind their back. newlinechar  newlinechar I certainly would not have gone to such lengths as to pursue a series of resignations. People are entitled to their opinion, and I am not so sensitive that a word like 'sleazeball' would hurt my feelings. This banker is setting a bad example for a lot of people, showing that money buys the power to intimidate, and the power to intimidate means you can dick around with people's lives with little consequence. I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as irresponsible, uncaring, and petty and I especially wouldn't want my children to pick up such character flaws. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, his reaction ended up more than justifying this teacher's choice of vocabulary.

In fact, one of the reasons I suspect our Venture crew broke off from the Boy Scout troop was due to the constant reduction of all hiking/backpacking experiences to the lowest common denominator in terms of difficulty. We had more than a few morbidly obese Boy Scouts, both youth and adult, that hampered our experience in 'plain ole' Boy Scouts.

I agree with the point that for some suicidal feelings are not necessarily untreatable and I am not saying that suicide or euthanasia should be taken lightly.

I recently heard a really good description of the difference between introverts and extroverts. Extroverts get their 'energy' *from* other people, while introverts get their 'energy' from within. Introverts may also feel that extroverts 'suck' the energy from them (in that they feel drained after a lot of social activity). newlinechar  newlinechar Extroverts may not realise that introverts need to recharge and feel stressed/drained by forced social interaction. This can make certain prolonged church events (e.g. a church camp or even just a bible study) quite painful events for an introvert unless the leaders (who let's face it are much more likely to be extroverts) aren't aware of the needs of the introverts. newlinechar  newlinechar It does go both ways though; if the decision makers are introverts then the extroverts in the group will likely get bored with the lack of social interaction.

I'd be happy to tell you.   newlinechar  newlinechar When I write my characters I am essentially just stealing them.  Sometimes they are people I know in real life- often times they are a combination of different people.  Sometimes I take a character I've seen on TV, or read in a book.  Sometimes I pluck them right out of movies. newlinechar  newlinechar Often one of the characters is me- or at least embodies some specific subsets of my personality.  Sometimes a character is me as I want to be. newlinechar  newlinechar Aaron Chen is based on a guy I knew very well.  He was an odd mix between nerdy scientist and crazy gangsta-rap lovin' party guy.  He was always a bit emotionally detached, so writing him into a post-apocalyptic nightmare didn't require much tweaking at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar Chen keeps his wits about him, but ultimately he is more of a follower than a leader.  His goals &amp; motivations are very superficial.  Whatever deep longings he had, he has now locked away deep inside him.  He will be privately depressed, but won't want to let the others know.  Ultimately he tries to make the best of the situation by satisfying his animal needs as best he can.   Given a long enough timeline, I think we will see Chen have some sort of emotional crisis- but that will probably far exceed the timeline I have in mind for this story. newlinechar  newlinechar The character of the narrator in this one is quite a bit of my actual personality- slightly dumbed down, but ultimately striving for a rational picture of his universe.  He is also much more emotional than I am- which is easy to write because I just take what I imagine my natural feelings would be in a situation and then amplify them.  His goals &amp; motivations are the same as mine would be: paranoia, a desire to prepare and survive, and to search for an escape from the nightmare. newlinechar  newlinechar You were very observant and absolutely right about Karen.  She is by far the most elusive character.  She is the last woman on the planet, so the narrator sees her as femininity incarnate.  She is the nurturer, the sex object, the peace-keeper.  She is powerful and mysterious, intimate and distant. newlinechar  newlinechar Karen is the combination of women who have loved me, and women who have hurt me- wrapped into one package- so when I write for her I borrow from any one of them.   newlinechar  newlinechar Her goals and motivations are something primal.  She is the cavewoman who has found two cavemen to take care of her in a hostile world.  She keeps them both happy as best she can to ensure her own survival- but whether this is a conscious act or simply instinct... that's part of her mystery.

Oh, yes, cp -l is **quite** handy!

&gt; That is false. White Phosphorus is not banned under any international law.  newlinechar  newlinechar Incorrect. Incendiary weapons are banned regardless of whether they are WP based or not, under art. 1 of CCW Protocol III (Incendiary Weapons) 1980. The CWC 1992 is irrelevant for the matters of incendiary weapons. There are WP based weapons which are considered incendiary and therefore are banned. The false argument that all weapons containing WP are incendiary weapons and therefore are banned is promulgated by antizionists who engage in deliberate obfuscation to claim war crimes where none are present. newlinechar  newlinechar Do note that, without any regard to the above, Israel has not ratified CCW III and is not legally bound to follow it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's true that it is illegal to use it indiscriminately or against civilians - but that hold true for every weapon known to man.

For example, if Polaris is 70 degrees up in the sky, we're on a circle 20 degrees down from the Pole, because that's the locus of points from which Polaris would have an elevation of 70 degrees.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now imagine we take two more stars, fairly spread apart. If we know the time, we can put pins in the globe over which *they* are located. Now we measure the elevation to those two stars, which gives us two more circles. All three circles should intersect at some point.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That point is where you're located.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_navigation), which doesn't have good pictures.

I think you are misinformed.  newlinechar  newlinechar The F-22 production was halted (after the US had already manufactured many of them - I believe the number was over 100). The reason for the halt is twofold: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. The cheaper, more advanced F-35 Lightning. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The ban on exporting the F-22 to any other nation (including Japan, Israel, Australia - all very strong US allies, all interested in purchasing but not allowed) makes a constant production program unneeded. They are built one by one as needed for US interests.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also suggest you read an Economics book or two to better understand the symbiotic relationship China and the US currently enjoy.  newlinechar  newlinechar If the US stops buying Chinese goods they will falter - the state provided slave-wage factories will close or produce useless goods. If the Chinese stop funding the US buying their own goods, they will falter - they aren't giving debt because they are nice - they need a buyer so they do what they always do - they create one through the state. If the US finds another source of cheap debt and labor, they can move on and continue this cycle and nullify the debt as China struggles to find markets. The US remains the gateway for selling anything to anyone with the West in its sphere. The reason debt is undertaken - which, by the way, could be fully paid off with a tax hike to pre-Reagan levels within 2-5 years if need be - is because debt is cheap to China and expensive to the US politically. Taxes are shouted down in the US and enforced with executions in China. This is the simple fact of the matter.

Technically the right to not incriminate oneself (the 5th amendment) is different (not a lawyer, but I think so). The 5th says you can't be forced to testify against yourself or divulge information that would incriminate you (eg. Question: 'Where were you the night of the murder?' Truth: 'Breaking into Bob's Books' Your response: 'I plead the 5th.' The b&amp;e is unrelated to the murder, but admitting that you were somewhere illegal would incriminate you, so you can't be forced to answer that question. More modern example is you can't be forced to divulge passwords that are stored only in your head). newlinechar  newlinechar If the 5th amendment made logs illegal/inadmissible, security camera footage would be illegal/inadmissible.

Because he is making agnosticism (which is about knowledge, not belief) and atheism (which is about belief, not knowledge) into exclusive categories (which they aren't), as a result making the definition of atheism almost useless when talking about what people actually believe (hardly any atheists match his definition).  newlinechar  newlinechar He's aiding a common straw man tactic of theists, who define atheism in this way in order to call atheism a religion.

Class war - simple as that, and again Seattle's long and colorful history with public transit initiatives rears its ugly head yet again. Is there anything transit-related that this city has done that isn't a completely unmitigated failure? newlinechar  newlinechar SLUT has been a terrible failure, with almost no ridership any time, and is slower than biking the same route (I've done this myself, and beaten the SLUT without even trying). newlinechar  newlinechar The Seatac Link line is also connects a bunch of places off in the middle of nowhere, and conveniently misses probably the most important southern locale: Southcenter. The Seatac station itself is also an international embarrassment - I've had to sadly shrug my shoulders at *way* too many international visitors who wonder why they have to hike a half mile from the terminal just to get on the train... especially when the 194 stops literally right outside the terminal's doors! newlinechar  newlinechar This is class warfare at its most obvious, and why public transit in Seattle will likely *never* succeed. The culture around here is that only the poor use public transit, that anyone successful and worth their salt drives a fancy automobile - you see this everywhere in Bellevue. I see this all day with my east-side coworkers driving into work despite the fact that they pay through the nose for crappy parking, and have to walk a half mile to the office from their parking space anyways. Typical upper-middle class arrogance (note: I grew up in an upper-middle class suburb not much unlike Bellevue, I despise the culture). newlinechar  newlinechar Right now there's a gigantic body of water keeping the rabble out of their precious upper-class enclave of Bellevue, and honestly I think most Bellevue-ites like this concept. Any ease of transportation across the lake threatens their lifestyle, or at least their perceived lifestyle. newlinechar  newlinechar Seattle's city planning has been a gigantic clusterfuck so far, let's not make this worse.

Hmmm... My character development technique was probably influenced by stuff I read on the net.  Although I Kurt Vonnegut's stories aren't my favorites, I've found several of his How-To essays and quotes on writing to be very extremely illuminating: newlinechar  newlinechar For example he suggests not using flowery verbs when writing dialog.  Just use: 'he said', and not 'he exclaimed, he barked, he moaned, etc.'  As you can see I take that to heart. and rarely break from it. newlinechar  newlinechar He also suggests starting a story as closely to the end as possible.  Respect your reader, and don't waste their time.  I also take that to heart. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as writing characters goes- the most helpful thing I've ever heard was in that amazingly long and snarky youtube commentary on Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  newlinechar  newlinechar The critic challenged his friends to describe both the old and new Star Wars characters without talking about their jobs or what they did in the film.   Everyone had an easy time describing Luke, Han Solo, and Leia- but no one could think of anything for Qui-Gan, young Obi-Wan, or Queen Amidala/Padme.   That was a real eye opener to me.  It let me know that I should have certain definitive traits in mind for my characters, and that those traits should be expressed frequently through their dialog. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: as far as book recommendations: 'The Time Travelers Wife' is a good read, and just about the most character-driven Sci-Fi I've seen.

More generally: if the claim is reasonable and widely-believed by the community you're in ('the sky is blue'), it's up to the person questioning it to *disprove* it. newlinechar  newlinechar If the claim is contentious or widely disbelieved by the community you're in ('Jews done 9/11'), it's up to the claimant to prove it when asked. newlinechar  newlinechar In edge-cases like this, it's generally considered *polite* to at least *try* to find evidence on your own before questioning the previous poster.  However, if the community as a whole is divided about the claim the *claimant* should provide the evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar In particular, while these guidelines delineate the reasonable obligations to provide supporting evidence, if there is *any* reasonable doubt about the claim, either party should provide evidence *immediately* upon request, or whichever party fails-to loses the debate.  Dick-waving contests and deadlocks over procedural issues are therefore averted, and conversation flows more smoothly.

&gt;Yeah. That's what I can't understand.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand either, to be honest. I would happily eat eggs if they came from my own pet chickens, in fact I plan on keeping some of my own when I get my own place. Keeping hens is not really viable in a college dorm, heh. newlinechar  newlinechar However there are multiple problems with 'free range' eggs. First of all the term is very loosely regulated, so there are plenty of so-called free range farms that are not much better than battery farms (see this for example http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/wp-content/uploads/chickens.jpg). And of course the hens are slaughtered like any other when they are no longer productive; there's no 'retirement home' for spent hens. newlinechar  newlinechar But the more fundamental issue is the killing of male chicks at hatcheries. Since the males don't they eggs, they are useless to the industry and literally ground up alive once their sex is determined.  Even at the largely mythical 'humane' egg farm, there's no way around this problem. Even if the male chicks weren't killed, they would probably just be raised for meat; I sincerely doubt there's a demand for hundreds of millions of pet roosters.  newlinechar  newlinechar For that reason I don't think a commercial egg farm could ever truly be both cruelty-free AND economically profitable. It would be extremely expensive to keep roosters/old hens alive when they don't produce anything in return.

Honestly, I thought a gas line exploded a couple blocks away until I heard what happened on the radio.

&gt;I was never a big fan of the original. I was more of a Syd Barrett era fan. newlinechar  newlinechar That's an interesting take.  I play the Barrett solo albums from time to time, because I'm intrigued by the melodies... but I'm so very frustrated at how they are mostly unfinished and stitched together.  Early Floyd is brilliant in some of their more experimental pieces, and absolutely cringe-worthy when they attempt pop.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he contributed anything past A Saucerful of Secrets, which leaves quite a large gap between early Floyd and Dark Side. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't begrudge you your opinion, but I don't think I've ever met a Floyd fan who preferred Piper, for example, to even UmmaGumma (astronimy domine aside, of course).  Yours is a bold, and in my experience unique, position.

But he did not win the Award.  newlinechar  newlinechar Shaw, on the other hand, did indeed receive an Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay, 'Pygmalion', in 1938 (and the Nobel Prize in Literature, for separate work).  newlinechar  newlinechar So you can continue to tell your trivia question, with the likelihood that even more people will get it wrong.  newlinechar

Im not so sure that its the number of laws, so much as its the scope of the municipal unit. Ideally, a city like NYC should have the largest government possible, given its density and requirements for infrastructure, utilities, and services. NYC should be free to govern itself as it pleases, even if that means regulating the amount of salt in restaurant plates or the types of goods that can be sold within its borders. But NYC should not be plundered by upstate exurbs, or federal redistributive schemes (that wind up benefiting 'red' states the most). newlinechar  newlinechar There is a happy medium between those who would use government towards progress and those who consider it a moral hazard in and of itself...I believe that medium to be agreeing on smaller administrative groupings that minimize the impact of one distinct group of people on another.

&gt; Ever since you were a kid learning to read, you've been trained to match parenthesis. newlinechar  newlinechar That's true, but while we were learning that, we were also learning that addition looks like `1 + 2`, and calling a function looks like `sin(1.23)`. It seems a shame to me to keep the paren-matching and ditch the rest. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The extent of expressions is more clearly marked, which leads to trivial (and thusly ubiquitous) parenthesis matching and region support by editors. newlinechar  newlinechar That's a good point. Editors for other languages, of course, can and do work with more complex syntax, but it's a greater burden on the editor author. Personally, and this is because I'm a usability person, I'd rather the *software* go farther than the *human* in order to meet in the middle. Why should I, a human, deal with a less rich syntax just to make the life of my text editor easier? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Macros are already magical and hard to understand, making them moreso for something like infix operator syntax seems questionable. newlinechar  newlinechar I lump macros into two classes: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Ones that are syntactically and semantically similar to function calls, but they don't eagerly evaluate. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Ones that really do build some AST procedurally and do magical stuff. newlinechar  newlinechar I think #1 can be pretty easy to understand even with a richer syntax than s-exprs. For example, `if: foo then: bar` can be implemented as a macro in terms of this special form: `if: foo then: bar else: ()`. I don't think that makes `if:then:` particularly hard to understand or implement. newlinechar  newlinechar \#2 is much harder but, for me, is a less common usage. I prefer to optimize for the common case. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Why is infix syntax so important? Recruiting? newlinechar  newlinechar The number one thing you can do to make something easy for people to learn is to *leverage what they already know*. Find me a person who doesn't know `1 + 2` and I'll show you someone for whom infix doesn't matter. For everyone else, not supporting infix operators is, I think, a wasted opportunity.

Second rule of abstraction, you don't talk about abstraction.
You are right that climate change benefits certain big businesses and certain governments and politicians. You will also agree that certain big businesses and certain government bodies and politicians also benefit from it being no true. newlinechar  newlinechar So I think if you look at which interests are winning, I think it is those that benefit from it not being true. why? Because most scientists say we are too late. That if we really believed in it, we would have done something 20 years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Its obvious though that those that stand to benefit are certainly gaining more power.

I'm a wife now for over 8 years. If this chick emailed me with this nonsense I'd be disgusted and angry with her. I don't fucking care if my husband chats up some cam-whore and sees tits. I don't need to be asked for permission every time he wanks either. He is not out to replace me, and it is unlikely he would find a suitable long-term partner while he is looking for porn. I recognize that he is an intelligent and rational human being who can enjoy sex and value the comfortable life our relationship provides *at the same time*. I would not be concerned about him respecting me any less, desiring me any less, or loving me any less if he slept with someone different every day. It's just intimacy with someone else, not a plot to deceive or destroy me, not a violation of some emotional monopoly I'm supposed to have over him, not theft of property, nor defamation of character. It really pisses me off that not only are there women out there who ruin their own relationships with this petty jealousy and insecurity crap, there are others who delight in helping them do it by 'catching' these dirty lying men. 
I was on hormonal BC for about 5 years, and 4 months ago got a Paragard IUD. I LOVE IT. I don't have any health problems, but I really wanted to get off of the synthetic hormones.

I've also lost the 20 lbs I put on with the pill (plus an extra 5!) with absolutely no effort on my part. I have no plans for children within the next 10 years (or maybe ever), so the IUD seemed like a great choice for me.

Usually racism I encounter in the world is the same as I encounter it here.  Which is to say... it's usually subconscious.  The people who may believe that they are not racist - or I should say prejudiced - and are sincere in friendship and wanting equality for all people can be the same people that just have a sort of expectation that I may pick up on and they do not.  It's in the way you and I might look at the same thing and interpret it differently based on what we're expecting to see.  I've known plenty of white people at work and in college and whatnot and they were just as cool as anyone else, but occasionally they'd say something that reminds me that their upbringing was not the same as mine and they have ingrained ideas about their place in society and mine - and it's not personal and it's not about hate, it's just an idea of how things work or how they are supposed to work that places in their brain an expectation of superiority on their part. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure if I'm wording it in a way that makes sense, but most racism that I've seen is not some guy standing on a corner screaming I HATE NIGGERS; it's subtle subconscious ideas about where you belong and where I belong in the grand scheme of things.  And that's a societal thing; it's not their fault - so if I can introduce a new idea I do, but I rarely hold it against them. newlinechar  newlinechar That probably answers the relationship question as well.  It would be more difficult for me to date interracially because I do pick up on these things sometimes, and though you can overlook it in a friend, for a life partner you really have to work that out before you go forward.  I can't be with a person who subconsciously looks down on my people, even if he's not aware he's doing it.  But again (and I know I've said this a few times in this thread), love is love - and sometimes it overcomes things you didn't realize could be overcome.  So if you're interested in a beautiful black queen of your own, don't lose hope, fellas!

You aren't being rude at all, but I understand you don't want to offend me or my people which is very considerate of you.  newlinechar  newlinechar My doctor used to ask to speak to the voice, and yes, my voice would change. The best way to explain the voice change is that the people inside me wanted to inhabit my body as fully as possible, and express themselves as fully as possible, so I would feel that they sort of stepped into my body, and that they took on their own set of mannerisms and voice.  newlinechar As I said earlier, I don't like to do it anymore because its too exhausting. Usually it triggers a severe episode of total incapacitation for me and or admission into the psych ward, which I want to avoid. The best way now is that my psych asks me and I will ask my people and respond for them.  newlinechar I usually do go blank while the voices are talking. I am still there, but far away, and when my psych asks for me again, its like I just, no matter how hard I try, cannot remember what we were saying.

Yes, Piper was mostly Syd's album, and Saucerful less so. That's when Gilmour came in to try and copy Syd's style for a while, and the sound morphed from there to Roger exerting his personal influence on the sound more and more until Final Cut, which was basically a Roger Waters solo album as much as Piper was a Syd solo album. newlinechar  newlinechar There are many Floyd fans that are basically Syd and pre-darkside era fans. They are a smaller and dedicated group with a serious Cult following. I have Piper on CD, Mono 30th anniversary CD and Vinyl, as well as the Syd Solo albums on CD. I collected all the CDs up until the Wall, and didn't bother with final cut after listening to a couple Waters solo albums. I rarely listen to anything past Meddle anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar If you haven't heard the early singles, I suggest checking out Arnold Layne and See Emily play, their chart topping singles (in the UK at least) that put them on the map. They wouldn't have any hit singles again until Dark Side.

Perhaps I should have been more clear. In this instance, it seemed like the philosopher was trying to apply philosophical argument to something for which it is inapplicable. Specifically, the phenomenon of natural selection is incredibly well-supported by evidence, to the point that it probably could be considered a 'member of reality' (but tentatively, and always open to alteration in the light of new evidence), and I wonder if the philosopher has failed to realize that his accusations of tautology regarding the survival of the fittest will actually do nothing to change the fact that natural selection is real.

Well, IMHO, it is less irresponsible for a politician to hold himself accountable to his constituents by raising taxes to fund new spending, rather than simply putting new spending on the next generation's tab. One makes the current generation pay for the government spending from which it benefits (and doesn't fuck around with interest rates too much), and the other gives the current generation a handout at the expense of future generations (and puts upward pressure on interest rates).
But you have to understand that in order for someone to learn to play a musical instrument they must have a passion for music.  The passion doesn't come from the idea that they may one day be famous, the passion comes from the love of music.  So, although she may be a sexed-up pop princess, she still came to it from a musician's perspective, and that gets respect from fellow musicians.  Plus, she's actually written some of her own songs, if not all of them. newlinechar  newlinechar I seriously doubt that Fergie, Miley, Britney etc. have ever written an entire song by themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, with all of that being said, I don't own a single album by any of these people and I never will.

&gt;Incorrect. Incendiary weapons are banned regardless of whether they are WP based or not, under art. 1 of CCW Protocol III (Incendiary Weapons) 1980. newlinechar  newlinechar Uh..

There is acidosis (lowering of pH in the muscle) which probably contributes to the burning sensation, but it's not directly caused by the lactate. When you burn ATP, you produce hydrogen ions.

No, not really, if anything it's the exact opposite.  In my experience, the more emotionally independent men tend to be, the more successful, and even happier, they become('laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone'). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, I do think the lack of support, and ridicule from society, against men who are emotionally co-dependent is a big issue too. This is a behavior that tends to be generally accepted and supported in women but often also a cause for neglect and rejection against men(by both genders); furthering the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Agreed. In terms of ability to get score, Medic is easily the fastest in the game (not that score matters much right now). Calling the LMG underpowered reveals that whoever is saying hasn't tried the Engineer very much, either... newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of ability to generate score, I'd say that it runs Medic &gt; Recon &gt; Assault &gt; Engy right now. The reason I put Recon second is because of the Mortar, C4, and motion mine-- C4 on the crate is 200+ points guaranteed, and the motion mine is free spots. Engineer is last because the gun sucks and taking out a tank is worth 30 points unless you get the killshot. That said, an engineer supporting a good tanker has excellent score potential. newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, I play what we need at the time, or if we're winning, I play for unlocks. Score doesn't really matter that much to the team in many cases anyway-- an engineer who gets 30 points for hitting a tank can still be more valuable than the 10th sniper on your team.
Agreed.  It is a good book for starting out.  I would also assert that in addition to gaining mileage in drawing what they see, they should also work towards gaining that understanding of the form of the things you are observing.  It also helps to be able to mentally slide between looking at something abstractly and then being able to be analytical about the form.  So even for people with a lot of drawing mileage under their belts, it's a great exercise.

That actually wasn't the reason Christians weren't liked by the Romans, but whatever; not the point.

I'm sorry if this is nagging, but....what is it that makes this more favorable?

My current boyfriend seems to resent my experiance a bit, which may be more my fault than his (I may mention past boyfriends, not having sex with them, but just in general).  He's told me before that he wishes I was a virgin.  However, I dated the guy I lost my virginity to for 3 years.  I was his first as well, and during the whole relationship, I kind of wondered what it would be like with other people.  We had great sex, but I still wondered if this was just great because it was the only sex I had ever had.  Maybe it was because I was only 19 at the time (when we broke up), and immature and wanted to explore in general.  Now I know for sure how good the sex was with him, and how amazing my current boyfriend is.  I do not regret having multiple partners (though, there are a few individuals I wouldn't have minded not sleeping with) and I don't see the problem, especially given that my current boyfriend is the best I've ever had, and I could not be any more secure in that fact (never a thought in my head to sleep with someone else to 'see what it's like').  I see my experiance as a positive, but to him it's a negative.  So...please just tell me why the less sex partners in your current girlfriends past the better?

I disagree. That's too much of an earth based idea. I don't think an alien organism would have to have a form of replicating itself. What if it doesn't replicate to produce children?

What if it's not actually made of matter/ it has no chemistry? All that asked, I totally think there gotta be some form of life out there has something similar to our genetic replication out there but having a digital storage system like DNA is not a requirment, I think.

China is stubborn because the US Seventh Fleet intervened in the [Chinese Civil war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War). After the Korean War started, both Houses enacted legislation that put Taiwan under US protection threatening nuclear strikes. This was all while Chiang Kai-shek was [planning a reinvasion of mainland China](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8183412.stm).  newlinechar  newlinechar Chiang then ruled Taiwan with [an **iron fist**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek#Presidency_in_Taiwan) so Taiwan wasn't really a shining democratic state in contrast to Red China. They were both pretty awful. newlinechar  newlinechar My point is that their government and this conflict may not exist today without foreign intervention. Imagine if the American civil war was allowed not to reach its resolution due to foreign intervention, and having continual tensions with the South. Beyond that, when Chiang's government left the mainland, they took with them a great deal of wealth, art and historical artifacts with them. newlinechar  newlinechar Regarding reunification, Taiwanese businessmen have been investing in China for years and there has been improving relations (I don't know about now) between the two. More business, travel and cultural exchanges have been allowed. However, I don't think Taiwan will ever join back as long as the CPC is in power even with a HK-style government. So that probably means never unless there is armed conflict or if Taiwan's economy is so overshadowed by China that it elects to join.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even this is unlikely as Taiwan has actively promoted its own cultural identity separate from China in the educational system and in the press. In schools they are taught that they have a unique history, language, culture completely separate from China proper even though they pretty much speak Mandarin with idioms from the Shanghai-dialect. I have never met a single young person from Taiwan who supported unification. **China knows that for every decade they are culturally separated means a greater sense of cultural uniqueness and independence and a lower chance of the Taiwan people accepting reunification.**

My advice to you on time estimation is to do what I do myself: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * Do not answer immediately. Say you need some time to think it through and come up with a good answer. This is perfectly acceptable, and communicates conscientiousness. newlinechar  newlinechar * Know and understand utterly that you only work 4 days in a 5-day week. The other day is consumed by meetings, research, coffee and so on. Always base you time estimates on a 4-day week. newlinechar  newlinechar * Testing, documentation and handover are expected to be included in your estimate. Leaving those things out is a very common mistake. newlinechar  newlinechar * Work things out with a pencil and keep it in your work-book (get one if you don't have one) so you can go back to older estimations to help with the current one. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar HTH newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: spelling

IMO the article takes it a little overboard, but as you say, there is a grain of truth in it.  It's true, things got a lot easier relationship wise when I learned that most of the time when a woman vents to you about something, she's *not* asking you to fix anything.  This is reversed from when men vent to other men, they are usually implying that they would like your help or advice with the situation.  And I agree, encouraging men to share for the sake of sharing would help increase a lot of people's mental health. newlinechar  newlinechar I think establishing early on in a relationship that these types of conversations should always be prefaced with 'I need you to listen' or 'I need your advice/help' would do a great deal to clear this issue up.

&gt; There are no successful socialist economies in the world. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And whenever people start criticizing capitalism, then pro-capitalist 'libertarians' claim there are no true capitalist / 'free' market nations in the world. Trying to have it both ways - or are you not one of *those* pro-capitalist 'libertarians'? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; and ask you to defend your claim that they are the same and you run to 'How do they rise?' and a link to some socialist intelli-babble. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Because capitalist claims to property result from conquest. Then those claims are used to create corporations.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are many definitions of theft - different societies have different laws governing control over objects and resources. This control is basically how property is defined. Different kinds of laws mean different concepts of property. Some wealthy property owners, when confronted with the possibility that the (more numerous) poor may vote for higher taxes on the wealthy, will argue that taxation is theft. Other less wealthy people, particularly those who work under someone else, may believe exploitation is theft. Then there's Proudhon's famous declaration that, 'Property is theft.'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The following are reactions to the concept of conquest from two different types of pro-capitalists.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Ownership Through Conquest is Justified** newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This view claims that conquest is justified because the conqueror risked his life (or at least risked the lives of his minions) in battle, and thus has earned the right to control.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar However, these pro-capitalists are opposed to the concept of an anti-capitalist revolution, claiming that would be a violation of their property rights. If employees 'conquer' their places of work by escorting their boss off company premises, these pro-capitalists do not see that as a 'legitimate' form of conquest.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Ownership Through Conquest is Not Justified**  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Other pro-capitalists do not believe conquest is justified and yet they oppose returning conquered land and resources to the natives (or their descendents). They believe conquest is an injustice, but do not have a good idea of how to rectify that injustice.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Conquest results in wealth for the conquerors. Then that wealth is distributed to cronies and offspring. On and on it goes - not just in this country, but around the world. If you trace back the history of ownership of land and resources, how much of it doesn't originate in conquest (or what some would call theft)?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar **Why Have Society?** newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I don't (that's right, don't) support giving back everything to the natives (or their descendants). Instead, I assert that the resources be used for the benefit of everyone in that area, whether it's later settlers, recent immigrants, the natives, whatever. Human beings form societies in order to protect themselves. The point of the political, economic, and religious systems they set up is to benefit as many of the individuals in the population as possible. If the system they've set up has been going down the wrong path and is now hurting more people than helping, then the system must be abolished / changed.  newlinechar  newlinechar

National growth does not occur from cost cutting. We've had 8 years of it. Some people may choose to retire.  There will be new people entering the job market and the IT engineering world.  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's forget that IT engineers are our future for a moment - since you don't think it is.  newlinechar  newlinechar What if our future were small manufacturing?  Then, we need process engineers.  What if our future were furniture design?  Then we'd need designers.  What if it were nuclear and solar power?  Then we'd need electrical and mechanical engineers.  What's not to like? newlinechar  newlinechar There is an issue today and it is lack of growth.  That issue is - unless we stop trying to arrive at increased profits only by cutting costs we won't have national growth.  Think about it.  If I cut cost, and you cut cost, and every producer does, all we have done is to shrink the economy. To change this, the corporate CFO has to see a more optimal bottom line reflected by growth. newlinechar  newlinechar What does that take?  It takes having a greater reward for reinvesting in your corporate growth and a lesser reward for declaring immediate profit.  This means delaying profit in favor of corporate strength and growth and sustainability and the added investment required must also appear to be more attractive and a wise choice to the stockholder.   newlinechar  newlinechar Making this happen at a national level is done with policy instruments.  Other countries are able to attract investment.  Otherwise, we would not be experiencing such competition.  We need to change our policies to encourage growth instead of asking corporate CFOs to constantly 'save cost.'

You've got more or less the right idea. Most commercial software packages for animation, modelling and rendering include both modeler and renderer, and they appear to the user as a single program (though often they are not). newlinechar  newlinechar Blender has both renderer and modeler components; POVRay is only a renderer. Blender exports to a variety of formats, but I don't know how useful any of them are for renderers (certainly, POVRay is right out, but there are other ray-tracers out there). As I mentioned previously, there are modelers available for POVRay; the ecosystem for POVRay is such that you can have modelers that export to multiple renderers (of which POVRay is only one) and multiple modelers that export to POVRay. This, theoretically, lets the community be more diverse, and it follows the UNIX edict of 'do one thing, very well'. POVRay renders scenes, very well.

**Ranger** A distinction must be made between being in a ranger unit (e.g. 75th Ranger Regiment) and wearing the ranger tab.

A community has a right to set ground rules.

It's a perfectly fine option for any game that's not a MMO.  Steam check the files on your system against the files they have for download.  Since a MMO updates itself outside of Steam, the files you would have on your computer are different than the latest files Steam has.  Hence, it will re-download every file that has been updated by the MMO patcher. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Moral of the story is: Don't verify the local files for any MMO downloaded through Steam. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar p.s. Most patchers for MMOs should have an option to do a full file check to re-download any corrupted files.  Do that instead of having Steam check.
No, its the legitimate legal precedents of DOMA (VA does not have to recognize their civil union) vs Full Faith and Credit Clause (states adhere to rulings of other states regarding marriage, custody, alimony, child payments).     newlinechar This is major because VA supreme court already sided with VT and recognizes Jenkin's custodial claim, IE ignored DOMA.

Hmm...that's tough to say.

I think the human mind is great actually but theres only a limited amount amount of chemicals, electrical signals and pure poundage . I think the brain compensates for this by fragmenting memories into smaller pieces that when are recalled are reconstructed. Our memories may seem limitless because we can never recall what we forget and on a daily basis of taking in information we do forget a lot of useless info. newlinechar  newlinechar To be clear I think human brains are well beyond the petabyte level in terms of raw information stored in such as audio visual. Thats not even considering all the information it takes to run the body...

I think the community standards would be the single largest factor in the success or failure of something like this. The application itself can't really enforce these kinds of points without true AI, so its role would primarily to encourage good behavior and make it easy. newlinechar  newlinechar I envision the application displaying the debate over an issue in a graphical layout, with functionality for participants like 'Contest this fact', 'Point out contradiction', etc... newlinechar  newlinechar To be honest, I think the type of application I have in mind is too big and too risky for APP web developers to consider building...your time would probably be much better spent taking an existing infrastructure and adapting it to our needs as much as possible through community standards, as you suggest.

Did you interpret my post as denying this? newlinechar  newlinechar My point was that 'evolution' is a theory based on logic and reason, not an object that we have encountered, and logical critiques of it are thus of paramount significance insofar as a critique of the logic of the theory would undermine our only reason for believing it.  You *see* objects, but you *formulate* theories, so it's not like denying the theory of evolution is denying part of reality in the sense that it's trying to deny something that we should believe solely based on intuition irrespective of what logical reasoning says; the theory of evolution, given that it *just is* a chain of logical reasoning, is in fact properly critiqued by such reasoning. newlinechar  newlinechar As it happens, it's reasoning that is overwhelmingly compelling, but this doesn't change the fact that it's a prime candidate for the target of logical investigation.  It's just silly to think that philosophy makes use of logic and reason but science doesn't, just as it's silly to think that science makes use of evidence that philosophy ignores.
Obviously #1 is more intensive for the 20th of a second that it takes but, it overall uses far less resources which is ultimately better for battery and better for overall performance.

How do you get the jealousy out of your head? newlinechar This is a huge hang-up of mine.

If I could give my coverage here to your son for the year, I would. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: As it would happen, about 4 years ago my mom was involved in a motorcycle vs. car accident, she was on the motorcycle. All I can say is I can't thank enough that she was wearing a helmet, which happens to be optional where her accident happened (BC). In any case, she is still seeing all of the different Therapy workers you listed above and then some at least once per week so I know exactly how difficult it can be. I don't know why you guys can't seem to agree on giving everyone the care they need, but I wish it to happen soon and hopefully alleviate some of the monetary stress that the whole accident has placed on your family. It's bad enough that you need to worry about organizing, planning, driving all the extras that come with doing all the therapies, but to have to worry about how you're going to pay for those? It's unjust in my eyes. Your son didn't get that injury as a result of any poor choices, which is basically everybody's reason for not supporting Universal Health Care, so the argument doesn't apply. Yet, you get shafted anyways because of the many people in your Country who can't seem to plan ahead more then 5 minutes. newlinechar /rant

For once I completely agree.  If they are going to spend the money on trains, they should spend it on speeding up existing lines not building these fancy new systems.  Amtrak takes almost 8 hours to go from Pittsburgh to DC or from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, both ~4 hour drives.  Why?  In many places the track is so badly maintained that you slow down to ~20-25mph (I checked on my gps).  Plus waiting for freight trains to go through.  I can't imagine upgrading much of the current railway to average 50mph would cost the billions that are going to be spent. newlinechar EDIT: homonym fail.
Whatever the history, it is now up to the modern Taiwanese to decide their fate, not the Chinese. US arms supplies just make sure that this will not be at the barrel of a gun. One of China's cultural weaknesses is that they bear a grudge long after it becomes relevant. A sign of political maturity would be for the Chinese elite to look at Taiwan through more modern eyes and see that it matters not who runs Taiwan, just so long as there is economic and cultural exchange. I believe this is happening, though China's recent bellicosity about US arms sales belies this. newlinechar  newlinechar Please leave the US Civil War out of this. It is completely irrelevant as it's causes were very different. You clearly know very little about it as the British and French aided both sides.

I agree but I think you've forgotten about increasing efficiencies.   newlinechar I can't find it now but I read somewhere that fuel injection moved the peak oil date back by 40 years at 1990 levels of usage. Hybrid and electric vehicles are just about to go big and this will also move the date back by years. Consumer solar is extremely promising, it looks like commercial rollout of entire roofing made of solar panels is coming in 5-10 years. Windpower also is advancing in terms of kW/$. Temperature differential and wave-power also have very promising ideas. newlinechar  newlinechar All these advances (except temperature diff. and wave power) are past the research stage and nearing the end of the development cycle. Even if there is no huge innovation of radical new science, there is no danger of peak oil occurring.

I agree that a serious consequence of writers like Zinn is polarization among the readers. I would love to see more critical thinking skills taught in our schools or by parents or whatever.

It seems that so much of John's gospel is like this - these little details thrown in that would otherwise normally escape the narrative. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, when Jesus feeds 5000, John tells us that 'There was much grass in that place. (6:10)' newlinechar  newlinechar When Jesus gives the discourse on the light of the world, he does so in the treasury of the Temple, beneath the four huge lampstands that gave light to the courtyard and the surrounding area of the Temple Mount (8:20). newlinechar  newlinechar When Mary anoints Jesus at Bethany, we're told that the fragrance filled the house (12:3). newlinechar  newlinechar As Peter stands outside the house of the high priest, we're told that he gathers with others around a *charcoal* file because it was cold (18:18). newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps my favorite one is in the narrative of chapter 20, where Peter and 'the disciple whom Jesus loved' run to the tomb.  And John tells us that 'the other disciple outran Peter.'  It's just a funny little detail - 'Ha!  I outran Peter!' newlinechar  newlinechar It's those little inconsequential details that I absolutely love about the Gospel of John.  They add almost nothing of theological significance, but they give us more of a portrait of what it was like to follow Jesus so closely. newlinechar  newlinechar

I am in no way a Glenn Beck fan.

Fairness.  I'd like to see a band that wasn't plastered all over the radio and supported by big labels win an award.  I'd like to see the list of best albums of the year and feel that even ONE of them deserved to win it.  The radar of Grammy judges is so narrow as to almost completely miss out on entire genres of music.  How often do deserving bands win awards while ancient hacks and has beens win awards year after year, while media darlings like Taylor Swift beat out more creative, intelligent and far reaching artists like the other ones mentioned in this thread?  The Grammys are self-congratulatory and reward the same assholes while new artists who aren't supported by major labels get zero attention and no way to break into the mainstream.  They're a sham and a mockery of music more than a celebration.

&gt; Their professors have argued, with some success, that rights should be granted not to individuals alone, but to whole classes of people, too. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I can't find much wrong with that, gay rights for instance requires granting rights to a whole class of people. And certainly granting women rights, as a class of people, was important during the early part of the 20th century, to balance historical lack of rights.  newlinechar  newlinechar At any rate, how many people took women's studies in college? I can't think of a single one of my friends, male or female, who did. Rants like that are stupid, they assume that institutions require students to take women's studies courses or that women's studies material leaks over into every other aspect of college life (untrue).  newlinechar  newlinechar How many of you ever encounter 'radical feminists' in real life ? I think I've met one, honestly...and I went to a really liberal college.

I'd said death is reasonably certain.  You live for awhile, and then you die.  You turn off, end, etc.  I think most people couldn't accept that, howver, and thus the need for religion kicks in.  Why are we here?  Why be alive?  There MUST be a higher purpose (or so their thinking goes), so what is it?  This question can be answered by preachers, rabbis, and imams because they have special godly knowledge that mere humans do not possess, and thus you should listen to every word they say and believe it.   newlinechar  newlinechar Just reading over that logic, I am amazed that anyone believes it.  I think that people are raised on religion from a young age and then get used to it and become nostalgic for it if they leave it.  It gains credibility by virtue of you growing up with it.  
The word 'gullible' doesn't have a page on Wikipedia though.

&gt; What if it doesn't replicate to produce children?  newlinechar  newlinechar Then it's replicating. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Or have a limited lifespan like organisms here on Earth? newlinechar  newlinechar Not all do. Clonal colonies (plant) have been known to endure for tens of thousands of years; and of course the hydra (animal) does not experience senescense.

Without these, there is no life.  So... yes.  An alien organism *would* have to have a form of replication.

It is still relevant as the dispute has not reached a resolution due to foreign intervention. It is at a stalemate just like N and S Korea. China wants it back, and Chiang wanted China proper back even up to the 1970s. Regarding the passing of time, China still is offended whenever people visit that Japanese war shrine. Israel still brings up the Holocaust even after the war resolved and reparations were made.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with the weapon sale is that this would mean increased sense of security and more importantly greater power projection within the region. Remember that Taiwan wanted F16s, which they did not get, and they got Harpoon antiship missiles. This also means less chance of reunification even with more cultural exchange.  newlinechar  newlinechar About the US Civil War, you are wrong. Both were domestic civil wars, but the US managed to keep [foreign actors out of it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War#Blocking_international_intervention). France [declined naval support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_American_Civil_War) for the South.  newlinechar &gt;William L. Dayton, who was appointed minister to France by President Lincoln, met the French Foreign Minister, Edouard Thouvenel, who was perceived to be pro-Union and was influential in dampening Napoleon’s initial inclination towards diplomatic recognition of Confederate independence. However, Thouvenel resigned from office in 1862. The Southern delegate in Paris, John Slidell, made offers to Napoléon III : in exchange for a recognition of the Confederate States and naval help sent in New Orleans to break the blockade, the Confederacy would sell raw cotton to France. Count Walewski and Eugène Rouher agreed with him, but British disapproval and, especially, the first Union military victories forced French diplomacy to refuse this plan. newlinechar  newlinechar 
But saying that, what led to the rise of our throwing ability? Surely by your regressive (not an insult, just working back through the reasons for something developing) logic, the cause of that ability would be what separates us, and then the cause of that ability, ad infinitum. Infinite regression is a dangerous path to go down. Then again, it's turtles all the way down.
I am female and my mom and I were driving across state when her car got a flat. We pulled over on the interstate and I got out the jack and as we were trying to get the bolts off, this happened. A middle aged man in a truck pulled up in front of us, and came to help. He changed the tire in under 3 minutes, and refused to take the $20 my mom offered him. In retrospect, that scenerio could have ended differently, but it was broad daylight and a busy highway. We were glad for his help, but when my mom told her friends about the incident, they looked at her like she was crazy, saying we could have been raped or worse. Looking back, it's not as though we could have prevented that if it were his motive, unless we stayed locked in our car until a tow truck or cop car arrived.

Your post is tailored to larger organizations.  In a smaller client driven atmosphere, it is almost a requirement to underquote your time, otherwise they move on to your competitor.

Fellow developer here.  Here are some ideas I'd like to see in webapp format, from easiest to hardest. newlinechar  newlinechar Die Roller: Now, there are LOTS of dice rollers online but they all suck for one reason.  They all have me TYPE.  When I dm, I'm clicking back and forth like crazy. newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see dice and numbers, and when I click on them, have it build up.  So there's a d4 and a d6 button, etc, and if I click 'd6, d6, d6, 5' I get 3d6+5.  No reaching for the keyboard. newlinechar  newlinechar Another more generic idea would be the NPC creator.  This webapp should have persistence.  When I need a random NPC, say a shopkeep, I hit the random button and get a name, personality, age, drive, etc.  This also comes with a field of notes.  And if I like him, I can hit save and he's successfully persisted for me to look up later.

Ah cool.  I think the thing to remember is it's not [pardon the expression] white or black.  Being totally blindsided to racial/ethnic stereotypes is just as bad as totally believing they apply to all situations. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if I see a black person on the street I'm not going to jump to 'he's a criminal' but if I'm alone and in a neighbourhood I'm not familiar with and I see a group of teens [white too not just black mind you] I might think 'keep an eye on them.'  It's not unhealthy to fear things you don't know/understand.  If we didn't recoil from animals we don't know for example we'd fall prey to all sorts of nasty things.  It really becomes a problem when you act on it though and the fears are not justified. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm glad you were able to approach the things that made you uncomfortable and move past it.

You're dead on.  When a bunch of people decide they want your stuff and pass a law that lets the government seize that stuff, it's called tyranny of the majority.  That's why we have constitutional rights, and they work pretty well most of the time.  But this is a pretty serious failure.
It was never about Bin Laden, Bush made that clear a few months after the invasion. Even if it was, it's not legal to invade a country in order to extradite a criminal. Even if it were legal, there's still a statute judicial that would have to be followed. Before you judge someone, you need evidence. The US government never provided any evidence. For obvious reasons. First, there probably are none. Chances are the people who masterminded 9/11 have killed themselves. Second, how can a guy sitting in a cave plan such an intrigued scheme.  newlinechar  newlinechar But lets assume it was Bin Laden, which I think it probably was, you have to ask another judicial question: motive of the crime. And that's a jar of worms the US government would never want to open, as it follows further questions about ourselves that we *really* don't want answered.  newlinechar  newlinechar Fuck Bush.
I always find it odd when the BBC uses American terminology. An english billion is 1,000,000,000,000, wheras 1,000,000,000 is one milliard. I find this a lot more sensible, and these are still used by the Danish.

I appreciate the fact that I had the opportunities I did; whether it was my own merit (I tend to think so) or affirmative action, well... it gives me the opportunity to help my community.

Well the diffuser isn't apart of the chassis tub - it can be changed in case of damage etc. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the difficulty stems from it needing to be an integral part of the overall design.

Why?
I really hate this argument.  You do understand that you're at a job right? For a lot of people, naked women are a source of enjoyment (a lot of enjoyment) so why should companies be cool with allowing their employees to go ahead and start looking at nude photos, wasting company time, oh because Scandinavia lets their employees do it?  You say tits aren't that big of a deal, and I make the argument that to some people they really are (fap fap fap) so how would a company know if you're just 'cool' with tits or you're if you're going to start beating off over tits?  Having a policy at your JOB does not equate to sexual repression and social dysfunction, you're just blowing smoke our of your condescending ass here. newlinechar  newlinechar And secondly there's people that really ARE uncomfortable with it, even in your precious Scandinavia.  You're not the only one at work, there's other people around, and there just might be somebody that simply does not feel comfortable watching you touch yourself at work over a set of tits. newlinechar  newlinechar Every single time there's a NSFW tag on something like this, there is this same argument and it's just completely stupid.  If you don't like it, go ahead, look up some tits and work maybe somebody will notice you taking a stand and rally the troops to push for the allowance of tits at work.  But I doubt it. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the only one sexually repressed here just might be you if you can't wait till you get home to look at a naked woman.

All of that is inside the realm of human thought, based on what we have experienced and observed here on this planet.

There's another word in the same vein, *[anaphero,](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G399&amp;t=KJV)* which literally means 'to bear up.' It's used in terms of offering a sacrifice and also as a word for carrying a burden, as an animal carries its load; it also has the connotation of bringing up a person or matter in prayer, which speaks to the *intercessory* role of the Old Testament priesthood. (Important to keep in mind when reading Hebrews.) The central part of the Eucharistic liturgy is called the *anaphora.* newlinechar  newlinechar Depending on the emphasis we bring to passages conatining *airo* and *anaphero*, there are a number of places where the Protestant west reads penal substitution into a passage while the Greek east reads it in terms of Christ's *carrying away* both sins and the pain they cause.

I'm not sure where fonzie588 was headed with that but... newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You can have both an analog phone line and a MagicJack plugged into an Asterisk system.  You'll have to google 'Asterisk MagicJack' to get the correct configuration (from the looks of things, there's some good information on the MajicJack forums about how to do this) but it does work.  As for running an analog line into an Asterisk system, you just need an FXO card (so I guess that does count as specialized hardware...). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for your question about 'using Asterisk to join a MagicJack and phone line', you can have both lines come into an Asterisk and have the system pick up whatever trunk is not in use to make an outbound call with.  The comment about having to call the phone company to turn your line into a trunk is incorrect.  Once you have the POTS line plugged into an FXO port on the Asterisk, how you route calls to it is up to you.  Having to dial 9 (or whatever you'd like) is part of the call routing. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lets say that you have an Asterisk system and you have two phones, ext 100 and ext 101.  When you pick up ext 100 and start to dial ext 101, it sees that the first number you dial is a 1 and knows that you're dialing an internal extension so it will route the call across whatever local means you have set up (across the network if it is an IP call or using copper wire if it is an analog phone).  If you pick up ext 100 and decide to call an outside number, you dial 9 first.  The tells the system to pick up an outside truck and route the following digits out that trunk. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [Here's](http://groups.google.com/group/VOIP-Users-Conference/web/beginners-link-to-asterisk?pli=1) a good place to start with setting up an Asterisk system. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If I didn't answer your question or I just outright misunderstood it, let me know...

You prefer different.. like being a pussy and not doing anything? Awesome. I'm sure that'll get you a girlfriend. And yeah, it IS easy to say, you know why? Because I did it.

Yeah, the first few times are really fucking awkward and is seriously a blow to the already fragile ego. But the more you try, the less it hurts and the easier it is. But it doesn't get easier if you don't fucking try. There's no magical solution to be able to be good with girls. newlinechar  newlinechar But you know what's great about frat boys? They can get girls. Why? Because they're doing something right. Hey, I'm not saying find the love of your life by chucking a frisbee at them.

I mean, you don't even have to throw the frisbee at them, but you kind of sound like a bitch who needs a crutch to start a conversation (I mean you even said it yourself you don't know what to say so how about 'sorry about that frisbee that knocked your friend out. my name's grantrules. maybe you'd like to play a little defense for your remaining conscious friends and join our game?'), so that's a good one.

Didn't you read? Because they both did the same basic thing - successfully reinvigorate their series in different ways. While I think Metroid Prime is the better example, I'm glad he put the two together. It means they'll focus on the smaller-name games, which is a lot harder than listing a couple famous gamings and being done with it. One of the better lists out there.

That is true, and its enforceable because the Federal Reserve Corporation retains true legal title at law to all currency it issues, and the holder of that currency only has equitable title to use the notes, according to their terms of agreement of the legal title owner (the Fed).  It is the United States that enforces the Codes that applies to the use of the currency. newlinechar  newlinechar This occurred in 1933 when redeemability of the notes was removed when the US went bankrupt to the creditors behind the Federal Reserve Corporation and so no longer had true value at common law, but only value 'under the color of law' as a commercial instrument. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; My own opinion is that she should have all the rights a father would as long as those were requested in the divorce which they were. newlinechar  newlinechar I think this is the reason I'm against gay marriage, though perhaps I should say this is why I'm against all government sanctioned marriages. It seems like the child is being treated like a piece of furniture and not as a human being. Clearly every mother isn't suited to be a parent, but as a general rule of thumb they will have more vested interest in their child than a judge, lawyer or even the father. In this case, the 'father' is merely a legal relationship and has no real biological claim to the child. It seems equivalent to giving custody to a step-father. newlinechar  newlinechar Admittedly, if the mother was stupid enough to agree to a divorce settlement that included visitation, then she should be held to it. I however still find the claim that the child is missing the benefit of a second woman figure in her life a bit too rich. The child can get plenty of other fulfilling relationships without the need to be forced into a legal contract. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I suppose the 'father' should be let out of paying for child support if he/she can't be given visitation. It was a legal contract to begin with, so there should be a way to dissolve the legal contract and have the 'mother' pay a contractual penalty. Forcing the child through it all seems selfish.
Obviously he has a right to be furious. There are just smarter things to do in this situation than threatening to rob a bank.

The Constitution is not some illuminated text and there is no way that the founders could have predicted what would happen in the future.  Modern Republicans like to pretend it's still 1950, and Ron Paul wants to pretend it's still 1776.  Time marches on, regardless of what era your ideals are set in.
Yes, I wasn't speaking to this proposal in particular which is specifically for new launch systems but rather the philosophy of space privatization in general which has been gaining a lot of traction in certain circles. If you go on to Amazon for example and type in 'space exporation' you'll probably find books called 'Space: Free Market Paradise' and the such. Similarly if you look at online communities like the National Space Society and others you'll find that some view space as the next Libertarian frontier. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously most governments contract out to the private sector, but they are the guiding institutions in most cases. In the case of United Space Alliance I believe that NASA retains ownership of the Shuttle and United is responsible for operations. Still your point is well taken. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess I'm still stuck with optimistic notions of government lead forays into space even though I was born well after funding had been slashed.

Abortion is legal to save the life of the mother in the Philippines (which is consistent with her story), under the constitutional requirement to protect the life of the mother and child equally.  No hospital staff has been prosecuted for performing an abortion in these circumstances.

yeah, as a young lad I'd pretty much be barefoot all the time in the summer, roaming the woods and fields across all kinds of surfaces. Only trouble I'd have is with hot pavement on sunny days. I can also remember running in a distinctly different way than I have since I've settled into a shod life.

And I was lucky enough to have a huge forest right beyond the garden, filled with blueberries, hazel nut trees, lingonberries, juniper berries, mushrooms of all kinds, a weird fern root that tasted a bit but not entirely like liquorice, and wild varieties of some of the stuff we had in the garden. Summertime was an amazing time, when it wasn't time to play, it was time to snack.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *edit*  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think maybe I grew up as a hobbit kid, complete with the 'stealing vegetables, mushrooms and fruit from the neighbours' bit :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar I was a much bigger fan of the stuff you could pick right off a bush or pull out of the ground than the stuff bought in stores, but Dad did some good work with the storebought stuff (mainly not overcooking it) and I ate almost everything on my plate.  newlinechar  newlinechar My mother had a thing where she would get some celery, make a paste out of a bit of butter and some hardcore roquefort cheese and fill the gap in the celery with the paste. That stuff was awesome, it exploded with flavours of salty, bitter, sweet crunchiness, it was fatty and juicy at the same time, a complete mindfuck of a snack. Try it some time, but be prepared to hate it.

She got up on the box and raised the forty to her lips. Right then a state park pickup stopped right in front of the camp. We all grew quiet because no one thought this girl was 21. All eyes were on the cop. A slow smile creeped across the face as if laughing that such a tiny girl could chug a forty. We all cheered and she pounded that fucker down!

It's a term that groups a vast number of distinct civilizations, many of which have no commonalities whatsoever, either in language, customs, culture, religious beliefs, or anything else.

That's true.  But being in a cold environment for a prolonged period of time can make you more susceptible to infections, because of the decreased mucociliary clearance.  When cold air is breathed in and heated to body temperature, it is comparatively VERY dry.  The air is humidified with the mucous in your lungs which can cause it to become dry and more viscous.  This carbohydrate rich substance is very easy for bacteria to colonize and makes subsequent infection more likely.
Yes and sort-of.  It's very hot so at times it can seem like a majority of the women are topless.  There usually aren't that many naked people (you need some water on your person) but they exist.  There is a famous orgy dome that is basically a never-ending sex pit.

Hm.  I won't say it doesn't cross my mind, but it's probably not the immediate thought.

Wow, that was an excellent post.  It all comes down to the life cycle of an industry.  At first everyone can play and no one knows exactly what to do. Then dominant designs emerge.  From then on, it's a frantic effort to push a little further down a preset technological trajectory.  Innovation continues but the focus shifts to pushing more and more resources into incremental improvements instead of radical design shifts.  As the resource intensity increases a shake-out occurs and only a few 'firms' or 'teams' can keep up.   newlinechar  newlinechar If combat robots were consumer goods, this would be the point where the industry would become intensely profitable and a few firms would race ahead.  Unfortunately, the product for these shows was entertainment and not robots and there is (kind of) a principal-agent problem.  The incentives are set up for the contestants to do what is necessary to win in competition but the most efficient way to do this is to modify existing, successful designs and this makes the show less entertaining which kills the the show.   newlinechar  newlinechar So, in conclusion, to allow these shows to succeed over a long period of time I would suggest that the challenge for the robots must change over time to prevent the formation of dominant designs that reduce variety and the entertainment factor of the show. 
believe it or not, I've thought about getting in touch with him.  Read a story the other day about a town in W.

&gt; But, clearly, this isn't fair because X amount of money will mean much more to a poor citizen than to a rich citizen. Think utility theory: as a citizen collects more and more money each unit of money means less and less. newlinechar  newlinechar By rich you mean, richer? Y'know, the kind of rich which means you have less economic-burden? Should all sales-taxes be progressive as well? Lets change property taxes too; it's not fair if a rich person lives in a cheap property and avoids a properly burdensome tax; it should be a component of income as well. Fuck, why do we stop there?

This is all great, but it doesn't add up to anything at all. There's only two scholars here, Shanon and Williams. Neither are Historians, and Shanon in particular appears to be a total crank. No History is offered in any of this. It's all conjecture based on an arbitrary reading of Bible combined with Psychology and Pharmacology. newlinechar  newlinechar Richards, so far as I can tell, makes no particular claims about the origin of the Ten Commandments. Shanon does, but offers no evidence directly pertaining to the Historicity of the events he claims to explain. He approaches the problem as: we know Moses went up Mount Sinai and came down with the commandments, but we don't know how. newlinechar  newlinechar This is total BS. We don't know anything of the sort. The only reason to believe anyone called Moses was anywhere near Sinai is the utterly discredited Exodus narrative. And if you're going to believe the Bible's version of everything else for no reason, why change what happened on the mountain? Shanon seems to adopt the perspective of an Israelite waiting at the bottom of mount Sinai, watching Moses leave and come back with the Law and wondering what happened. This is simple fantasy and nothing more. newlinechar

What I am saying is that most women can see right though the manipulation of the conversation, where you steer it into sex, or whatever 'skill' you want to call it.  newlinechar  newlinechar They allow you to continue steering it because they don't have to do anything and if what they want is strictly some guy to bang them, there you are.  newlinechar  newlinechar You're acting like getting a girl to have sex with you, or to orgasm, is hard. It's not. It's been going on for thousands of years and has needed no classification as an art. It's not an art.  newlinechar  newlinechar

About 1,000,000,000 stars in each galaxy may have Earth-like planets. There are 500,000,000,000 galaxies. If my math is right, that means about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars in the universe may contain life-supporting planets. The chance is very high.

Ah!  But if the company is doing good enough to give one guy 100 million, what are you as a shareholder losing out on? newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I don't know how to really read this, but I'm going to make some stupid assumptions (Yahoo Stocks: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gs) newlinechar  newlinechar 'Volume' is currently at 9,683,540, I'll round up to 10,000,000 for ease.  My assumption is that's how many share's there are, which seems plausible. newlinechar  newlinechar That's 10 dollars per share they're giving to him.  Maybe make it 3 per share (he still gets 30 million) and give the shareholders 7 bucks per share each.  That seems like a better way of making the shareholders happy; Thus: You're getting screwed as a shareholder. newlinechar  newlinechar Then again, I don't fully comprehend stocks. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, his regular Salary should cover his mental distress for working as hard as he does.

Manhoef - that fucking sucked.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So, I have a question for you guys. I think I tend to look at women's MMA a bit differently given that I'm a woman. Did Strikeforce introduce women's MMA correctly?  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar IE, should they have taken Gina Carano (obviously a favorite among most fans) and had her continually fight slightly lesser opponents in order to have a constant cash cow that would introduce many other women fighters as well as given a little more eye candy to MMA fans **or** was it appropriate to bring Cyborg on immediately like they did, who is not generally favored by MMA fans (guys, face it, you know there is an 'eye candy' component to women's MMA still), but obviously is a better champion for women's MMA in the fact that she is just plain better (being a 'physical specimen' as she's often introduced)? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What say you? newlinechar  newlinechar

Running trails is different than urban running. I also prefer running barefoot since I always did as a kid, and developed callused feet. But running in urban environments is completely different.

with somewhat legal I mean the girls look 18 and they're not fucking donkeys and pigs. but I hate all the new CCC shit (the stuff they got on their new website, worst $30 you can spend newlinechar  newlinechar *for those not in the know, color climax is a Danish pornographic company that made porn in the late 60s early 70s... back when pornography was not regulated newlinechar  newlinechar so they made stuff for EVERY fetish you can imagine, including child porn (apparently with girls 7 to 11 years old, sick.), bestiality, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar if you ask around the company nowadays, there's a huge blank on their operations between 1967 and 1979, BUT WE PORNOPHILES KNOW newlinechar  newlinechar still, they remain the best source for jailbait porn, we're talking about 70s porn (so no barbies) featuring 18 year old girls, who might as well be 16 (in fact, after the ban on child stuff they increased the minimum age for porn to 16 in Denmark, so lots of CCC feature 16-18 girls... but it's hard to know)

I'm a bit surprised that there aren't more comments like this, now reading the thread I am a bit uncomfortable that my advice is BE someone else.  newlinechar  newlinechar But the way I acted before was also a choice.

I don't think he said there wasn't?  Point is that tryptophan doesn't exert that effect directly. newlinechar  newlinechar tryptophan -&gt; 5-hydroxytryptophan -&gt; 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) -&gt; N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine -&gt; 5-hydroxy-N-acetyltryptamine (melatonin) newlinechar  newlinechar Melatonin *does* make you sleepy, but the process of converting tryptophan into melatonin is by no means instantaneous and is strongly rate-limited by the paucity of certain enzymes (tryptophan hydroxylase being the main one).  Melatonin production is also favored by low levels of blue-wavelength light.  People tend to eat Thanksgiving dinner when it's dark out and so would probably be getting fairly tired at about the same time even if they abstained from eating. newlinechar  newlinechar Tryptophan can also be converted into the NMDA receptor antagonist, kynurenine, which is a psychotomimetic and hypnotic.  For comparison, ketamine is also an NMDA antagonist. newlinechar  newlinechar There's actually a number of amino acids in meat that could conceivably induce sleepiness.  I have no idea where people got the idea from that it was tryptophan that was responsible.  Then there are amino acids that would promote wakefulness, as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The real reason probably has something to do with insulin or possibly cholecystokinin release triggered by the consumption of food.

Well the whole point is that the community setting those rights is at the municipal level. Tyrannies of the majority become less likely when you're dealing with less people, and small municipal administrative units allow for ease of transit should you oppose the value system in a given community. newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, all majorities are not tyrannical. Also, what you consider your 'rights' are in fact variable. Look at the amendment process of the US constitution. Through it, rights are bestowed and withdrawn. This is an entirely legitimate process.  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, it seems more often than not libertarians advocate anarchism, rather than any system of government based on enlightenment principles of natural rights and the social covenant that necessarily infringes on those rights.

I mentioned that HERE, because it's pertinent. It's not a well-known secret what I do for a living on Reddit. In fact I have my own stalkarattzi who will downvote every time they see my username just on sheer principle. Most of the time I don't mention it, but when I DO (for the purpose of relating a story, verifying my experience, or establishing a knowledge pedigree, as it were) there will always be three or four comments on what a useless and horrible human being I am, based on nothing more than my chosen profession.

Don't confuse 'Nice Guy' with 'a guy who is nice.' newlinechar  newlinechar The 'Nice Guy' is the sort of twit who keeps going on and on about how nice guys finish last, all the girls want are assholes, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Guys who are nice are fine, I like to think of myself as a guy who is nice. newlinechar  newlinechar But the 'Nice Guy' has a bizarre sense of entitlement coupled with some truly unpleasant passive aggressive streaks.  They convince themselves that the reason they can't get a date is because they're too nice, and girls only date assholes, and completely ignore the tiny detail that they never actually ask girls for dates because they're too timid. newlinechar  newlinechar Look at the linked cartoon and the psychology behind it.  It's a mixture of 'you're too good for him', with 'you're stupid for going out with him', mixed with a lot of 'I'm so noble and White Knight I'd save you if only I had the balls to actually ask you out, but I don't so I'll pretend to be your friend instead'. newlinechar  newlinechar That's a 'Nice Guy' in the very bad sense indeed.

From my understanding the prison system has gotten very good at keeping it so that there is always something they can take away from you.
